Foster gets a love interest. An actor named Max Martini plays Burns, and it’s fun to see what happens to Lightman (Tim Roth) when I have a love interest. A lot of exciting stuff happens there. He is not who he says he is, so I clearly pick well, in terms of people that I date on the show. And, he gets into a mess of trouble and we have to help him get out of it. It’s kind of sad for Foster, in the end, but then she has Cal Lightman.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Q</strong>: How does that speak for Foster’s professional abilities that she can’t even pick a suitable man to date?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Kelli: I think that it’s more interesting to play, as an actor, when people make mistakes and they’re fallible. One of the things, in the true science of it, is that it’s hard to see what we’re in, in our own lives. It’s easy to miss a lot, when you’re emotionally invested. You don’t want to see the person that you care about so much behave in a certain way, or you tolerate it in a different way than you would for a friend who’s going through the very same thing. You’d go, “What the hell? Don’t you see? This is not right for you.” I’m sure that Foster sees her own shrink, even though she is a shrink. It’s not a surprise. She’s married to her work. Also, the way that it works with series television is that, all of a sudden, you’ll read a script and, in two days, you have this whole story and life that you’ve supposedly had for awhile, and you have this new person that you’re dating, but you had no idea about it two days ago. You have to inject all sorts of subtext into something that you’ve just been introduced to. And then, in the next episode, you’ll see them and they’ve been together for months, and you have to shift those things. We just hope that it works, at the end of the day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Q</strong>: What sort of shorthand is there, between you and Tim Roth, now that you’ve done so many episodes together?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Kelli: We have a shorthand, as actors, when we’re doing scenes together. And then, we also have a shorthand with the characters. As the show gets a chance to find its legs, and you get to make more and more episodes, that’s fun. We really know how our characters would respond and it is parallel to us. We have a good system. We spend so much time together, but we have fun, laugh and give each other space. He’s my work&nbsp;husband. But, they haven’t completely explored their friendship and relationship within the show as much. There is an episode coming up with a storyline that does a flashback to my time at the Pentagon when I meet Cal, so that they actually showed some of our sessions. It was fantastic and it was fun to do because it created, not just the subtext of what we created, but the real text of what has happened and how we’ve carried that with us, all these years, and the lies that we’ve carried, and how our relationship has developed. It was&nbsp;challenging because we wanted to get it right. Flashbacks are always really tricky, kind of like a montage. That can kill it, or it can also really inform it and give it a lot more life. I hope that it gives our relationship a lot more life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong>Q</strong>: Do you look at people to see when they’re being deceptive?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><strong>Kelli:</strong> I’ve always been interested in people and behavior. As an actor, I find people’s quirks very interesting. I’ve always been interested in how people lie. I know a little more than I used to, which freaks me out sometimes because I’ll get a glimpse, more often than not. But, I’m no expert. This whole tabloid world of television and being aware of people’s personal lives, so much more than we used to, is weird. I just want to let them be and not try to analyze them.</p><p><strong>Q</strong>: What is the first thing you’re going to do on hiatus?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p><strong>Kelli</strong>: I’m driving my kids to school. I get to be mom. Hopefully, we’ll be able to travel a little bit. My husband is doing a pilot for Fox right now, so he’s waiting to see if his show gets picked up. We have the trip if we have a show that gets picked up. We have a small trip if it doesn’t. We have the saving money trip, to go away someplace for a couple days. I didn’t want to work unless there was something that I really liked because it’s a 10-month year. It’s a pretty intense year. So, it will be nice to just hang out.</p><p><strong>Q</strong>: Did you do&nbsp;The Space Between&nbsp;while you were doing Lie to Me?</p><p><strong>Kelli</strong>: Yes. That was luckily just a day of work. It was a very long day, into the morning. It was a lot of fun. It was a camera rigged to a taxi, and it was barely staying on. It was falling off. It was that great thing of doing really, truly independent filmmaking. People kept asking us directions when we weren’t really a real cab. They thought we were Taxi Cab Confessions. But, it was fun. I looked incredibly strung-out. I played a junkie in it, who creates a lot of havoc and then changes the course of this kid’s life. And, that film got into Tribeca. One of my dearest, oldest friends,&nbsp;Travis Fine, directed it and wrote it. He quit the business and became a pilot for seven years, and then decided that he was done with that. He wrote a script that happens on the day of 9/11, where the plane gets grounded, and Melissa Leo plays the lead. It’s a really great story, so I’m very excited for him.</p><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
