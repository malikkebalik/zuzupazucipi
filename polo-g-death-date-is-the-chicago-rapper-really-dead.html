Many fans and media outlets have speculated about his demise, citing various sources and evidence. But is Polo G really dead? And if not, why are there so many false reports about his death date? In this article, we will try to answer these questions and clear up the confusion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Origin of the Death Rumors</h2><p>The death rumors about Polo G started circulating in 2019, when he was involved in a near-fatal drug overdose. According to his own account, he took too many Percocet pills and had a seizure. He was rushed to the hospital and survived, but the incident left him traumatized and depressed. He later addressed the situation in his song “Wishing for a Hero”, where he rapped: “I overdosed on them Percs, I ain’t know what I was doin’ / I put my life in danger’s way, like who the fuck I’m screwin’ with?”</p><p>However, some people did not believe that he was alive and well, and started spreading fake news and conspiracy theories about his death. Some claimed that he was killed by rival gang members, while others said that he faked his own death to escape the fame and pressure. Some even created fake obituaries and social media posts to support their claims. These rumors were further fueled by the fact that Polo G often raps about death and violence in his songs, and has lost many friends and family members to gun violence and drug abuse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Truth About Polo G’s Status</h2><p>Despite the persistent death rumors, Polo G is very much alive and active. He has released two successful albums since his overdose, The GOAT and Hall of Fame, which both debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. He also scored his first number-one single with “Rapstar” in 2021, and has collaborated with many other artists, such as Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, DaBaby, and Roddy Ricch. He has also performed at various shows and events, and has appeared on several media outlets and platforms.</p><p>Polo G has also addressed the death rumors and hoaxes in his interviews and social media posts. He has expressed his frustration and annoyance with the false reports, and has urged his fans to ignore them and focus on his music. He has also thanked his supporters for their love and prayers, and has vowed to keep making music and living his life.
