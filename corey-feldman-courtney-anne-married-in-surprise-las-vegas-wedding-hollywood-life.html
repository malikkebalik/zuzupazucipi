The 45-year-old Goonies&nbsp;star&nbsp;and his 27-year-old bride had spent the weekend having fun and celebrating their joint bachelor/bachelorette party at the&nbsp;Chateau Nightclub at Paris Las Vegas before the wedding. Looks like they decided they just couldn’t wait to make things official!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The wedding came less than two weeks after Corey popped the question to the model while they were celebrating their anniversary in Palm Springs. Corey reportedly asked Courtney to marry him by giving her&nbsp;an adorable note that said “Will you marry me?” and had two boxes — one for “Yes” and one for “No.” Clearly, she picked “Yes!”</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Corey Feldman — PICS</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>“She was surprised because we had both been so anti-marriage since we met,” he told <a class=external href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> after he proposed. “But seeing as she’s Canadian and with [<strong>Donald</strong>] <strong>Trump</strong> coming in, we didn’t want to risk being separated by new immigration laws.” While we hate that Corey and Courtney were that afraid of her being deported, we are still happy for the pair!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Courtney will now be stepmom to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Corey’s son <strong>Zen</strong></a>, who the actor shares with his ex-wife <strong>Susie Sprague</strong>. Corey has one more ex-wife,&nbsp;General Hospital&nbsp;actress&nbsp;<strong>Vanessa Marcil</strong>. We’re hoping the child star has finally found his match in the beautiful Courtney and wish them a long and happy marriage together!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, leave your congratulations for Corey and his lovely wife Courtney below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye5FsZpynoprGbrLEpZummZ5isLDB0a2lnrFdlruvsYymmKuqmZqxbrjArGSvnZeWwG7DxJ2boqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
