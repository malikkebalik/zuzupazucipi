She was born in 1979 in California. Both of her parents, <a href=#>Steve Austin</a> and Tina Austin, were actors. Her stage name Coco also came from her family as her sister called her “Coco” instead of “Nicole”. Soon all other members of her family started calling her Coco. When Coco was only six years old, she started learning how to dance and was even a part of the Albuquerque Little Theatre.</p><p>Austin began her modeling career when she still was very young, only 14 years old. She was involved in advertisements for different catalogs, calendars and also videos. From that time Coco Austin’s net worth began growing. In 2001 Coco started working in “Playboy”, and even appeared in such movies as “Desert Rose”, “The Dirty Monks” and “Southwest Babes”. Although these movies were not that popular they still added to Austin’s net worth.</p><p>After gaining more popularity, Coco appeared in different TV shows. For example, “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”, “Hip-Hop Wives”, “The Dr. Oz Show” and many others. In 2008 Coco with her husband appeared in the show called “Celebrity Family Feud”. As mentioned before, one of the main sources of Coco Austin’s net worth is her reality show, called “Ice Loves Coco”. This reality show has ended this year, but it has been mentioned that there might be another reality show created by <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>.</p><p>Talking about her personal life, she married to Tracy Marrow, better known as “Ice-T” in 2001. They are one of the most famous and successful couples in show business.</p><p>All in all, it could be said that Coco Austin is a successful television personality and model. Her career began from a very young age and that is why she is so experienced in this industry. She and her husband are involved in other projects which will probably become successful in the future. So there would be no surprise if Coco Austin’s net worth became higher. Coco is 35 years old but she is still acclaimed as a model and actress, so let’s hope that this will continue for many more years in the future.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.974358974359><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Coco Austin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million,</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>17 Mar 1979,</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tarzana, CA, USA,</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.57&nbsp;m, 1.57&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=18><td>Profession</td><td>Entrepreneur, Author, Media Personality, Fashion Designer, Actor, Dancer, Model, Businessperson, Entrepreneur, Author, Media Personality, Fashion Designer, Actor, Dancer, Model, Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American, American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Ice-T (2005- ), Mike Williams (1999 - 2003)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Chanel Nicole Marrow, Chanel Nicole Marrow, Chanel Nicole Marrow</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Parents</td><td>Steve Austin, Tina Austin, Steve Austin, Tina Austin, Steve Austin, Tina Austin</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Kristy Williams,</td></tr><tr readability=0.17391304347826><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/Cocohttp://www.facebook.com/Cocohttp://www.facebook.com/Coco</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/cocosworld</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.1875><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/cocohttp://www.instagram.com/cocohttp://www.instagram.com/coco</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1146910</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Think Like a Man Too, Santorini Blue</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>Ice & Coco, Ice Loves Coco, Ice & Coco, Ice Loves Coco, Ice & Coco, Ice Loves Coco</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Her curvaceous figure</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=40.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>My grandma actually put me in girdles when I was around nine or ten because I had hips even then, and she didn't want boys to be attracted to me.
