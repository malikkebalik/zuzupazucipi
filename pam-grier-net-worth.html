She is an actress who became famous back in the ‘70s, the role which made her known being Foxy Brown. She is a cultural icon, being also known as the Queen of Blaxploitation, and she was called cinema’s first female action star by director <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a>.</p><p>So just how rich is Pam Grier? Sources estimate that Pam’s net worth is $15 million, most of her wealth having been made in the film and television industry, plus from sales and royalties during a career now spanning more than 45 years and involving over 60 different appearances.</p><h3>Pam Grier Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Pam Grier graduated from East High School in Denver. In order to raise money to pay her college tuition at Metropolitan State College, she participated in beauty contests, and even placed third in the Colorado Miss Universe Beauty Pageant in 1967. During one of these contests, she was seen by agent Dave Baumgarten, who convinced her to move to Los Angeles in order to build an acting career. Her first job in LA was at the American International Pictures (AIP) company, where she was working as a receptionist. Here she managed to be cast in two film, “The Big Doll House” in 1971, and “The Big Bird Cage” in 1972.;she was making $500 a week for her perform ance in these films (about $3,000 today), the beginning of her growing net worth. She soon became an icon of the Blaxploitation movies, being also the first African-American female to headline an action film and to appear on the cover of MS. Magazine.</p><p>She continued to appear in numerous movies during the ‘70s, such as “Foxy Brown”, “Friday Foster”, “La Notte Dell’alta Marea”, “Black Mama White Mama”, and “Greased Lightning”. In 1979, Pam Grier made her first appearance in a television series, in an episode from “Roots: The Next Generations”, followed by roles in series including “The Love Boat”, “Night Court”, “Crime Story”, and “Miami Vice”. The actress was paid about $2,000 a week for her appearances in television series (almost $4,500 today), a steady if unspectacular addition to her net worth..</p><p>In the ‘80s, the actress had several important roles in mainstream blockbusters like “Fort Apache – The Bronx” and “Above the Law”. Again, modest contributions to her net worth ensued.</p><p>At the end of the ‘80s, Pam Grier fought cancer, which deprived her from accepting major role, and she focussed more on small stage performances. She went back to film acting in 1997, when <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a> chose her for his movie “Jackie Brown”, a performance which brought Pam a NAACP Image Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. After 2000, Pam Grier had appearances in television series like “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”, “Smallville” and “The L Word”, the latter as Kit for six series between 2004-09. With an annual income over $1 million, Pam Grier has done several low-budget movies for first-time directors in the last years. Pam is still adding to her net worth.</p><p>In regard to acknowledgments for her acting, Pam Grier was included in Ebony Magazine’s top of “100 Most Fascinating Women of the 20th Century”. She was given the “Career Achievement Award” at the Annual Chicago International Film Festival in 2008 and, in 2013, she was inducted into the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum Hall of Fame. Her memoir, “Foxy: My Life in Three Acts”, was published in 2010.</p><p>The actress is also the co-founder of the company Melting Pot Designs, which designs paper products. In her personal life, Pam Grier has never been married and doesn’t have children. She was engaged to Kevin Evans between 1998 and 1999. She also had a long relationship with Peter Hempel from 2000 until 2008. Pam Grier owns a ranch in Colorado with an equestrian facility and a 3,000 square-foot main residence with three bedrooms.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.06718464351><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Pam Grier</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>26th May 1949</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Winston-Salem, North Carolina USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Metropolitan State College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Clarence Grier, Gwendolyn Grier</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Rodney Grier, Gina Grier-Townsie</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nicknames</td><td>Pamela Suzette "Pam" Grier</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/pamgrier</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0000427</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Pictu...</td></tr><tr readability=26><td>Movies</td><td>Foxy Brown, Jackie Brown, Coffy, Friday Foster, The Big Bird Cage, The Big Doll House, Sheba, Baby, Black Mama White Mama, Scream Blacula Scream, Ghosts of Mars, Above the Law, Escape from L.A., Fort Apache, The Bronx, The Arena, Hit Man, Mars Attacks!, Bucktown, Just Wright, Jawbreaker, Larry Crown...</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>TV Shows</td><td>The L Word, Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child, Linc's, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=45.889236696364><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=11><td>1</td><td>You know, I had to bump heads with a lot of men in the industry. They were not comfortable with showing a progressive black female in an action role. As a strong woman, I was seen as a threat. There was a fear that women would mimic me in real life. I remember certain people saying: "Oh, she's taking our jobs, she's castrating men" -- as far as I was concerned, I thought: "We don't need to walk behind you, we should walk beside you."</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>2</td><td>When I was a young girl, I never thought of acting. I never thought of television, of fans, movie stars, signing autographs. It never crossed my mind.</td></tr><tr readability=48><td>3</td><td>(On the emotional back-story of how she landed Mars Attacks) I was familiar with the comic book, and Tim Burton had called me to audition, but one of my dogs was dying of cancer, so I wasn't in the frame of mind to audition to do that role. So I said, "I can't," and I turned down Tim Burton. And I remember one of my dearest friends who I knew before he became an actor - Michael Keaton, who was in Beetlejuice and should've won an Oscar for that role, he was so brilliant - I told him that I'd turned Tim down. I said, "I'm just not ready to read, because one of my dogs, one of my family members, is very ill. I just can't do it. So I passed." But they called back again, and they said, "Well, would you put something on camera?" And I said, "No, because what I'll put on camera is sadness, and I'm not ready to do that right now." I'm one of those people who can afford to say "no." Even to Tim Burton, as badly as I wanted to work with him because of Beetlejuice. And he related. He respected that. And then they called back again...and they said, "Well, you've just auditioned. Because in the story, she's a mom who protects her children. Even under the worst situations, she won't leave her children. She's a true mom." And I wouldn't leave my dog, not for anybody - including Tim Burton - or for a huge salary or to work with Jack Nicholson or Glenn Close or the rest of the stellar cast of that film. So he said, "You passed the audition. You wouldn't leave your family for me, so you've got it. And we'll shoot around you. We'll wait, and you let us know when the time is right, when you're ready to shoot." And I said, "Thank you, but it could be awhile. I don't know. But I'm not leaving his side, because I had cancer, and he was with me." But they waited. They shot around me until I was ready to say, "Okay, he's passed on. He let me go." And Tim and I have been great friends ever since...because I said "no." Sometimes you just have to say "no." But once I was in it, it was such a joy working in those scenes, and with Ray Jay and Brandon. And it was great to work with Jim Brown. We had scenes, too. It's amazing when you work on films of such stellar directors, you know the budgets are gonna be incredible and the sets are gonna be incredible. There's no expense spared. It's just gonna be fabulous. When you work with directors like that, on that level, you go, "Oh, my God, just enjoy it!" Because you know it's just going to be a superb experience. And not only did I learn a lot about myself, but I learned that I want to work with Tim Burton in anything. He's just a very special person.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>4</td><td>People see me as a strong black figure, and I'm proud of that, but I'm a mix of several races: Hispanic, Chinese, Filipino.
