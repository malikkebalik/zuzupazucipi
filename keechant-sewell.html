Mayor Eric Adams informed the media that Sewell would be the next commissioner of the New York Police Department. She will take over the position after the current chief of police departs at the end of the year. On Tuesday evening, Adams verified the post. Sewell would be the department’s third black individual and the first black woman to assume the job.</p><h2><span id=Keechant_Sewell_Bio>Keechant Sewell Bio</span></h2><p>Keechant, a resident of Queens, New York, was born on April 4, 1972, in Long Island, New York. She was raised in her hometown area and spent her formative years in Queensbridge Houses. Later, she moved to Corona and Jamaica, two nearby Queens areas, and her life dramatically transformed. She met her mentor, veteran NYPD detective John Wesley, whom she affectionately referred to as “Pop-Pop,” and acquired an interest in public service. Her father was a US Marine, therefore she grew up in a tight disciplined environment. She learned the value of “service and honor” from her father and surrogate grandfather.</p><p>She formerly worked as the Nassau County chief of detectives from September 2020, where she oversaw a workforce of over 350 employees. In terms of her background, she is a 22-year Nassau County police veteran who is well-liked in her department. Previously, she handled a variety of leadership positions ranging from overseeing numerous significant cases to negotiating hostages. The NYPD currently has approximately 35,000 officers. Eric Adams stated in his statement that Sewell would be a well-proven crime-fighter with extensive expertise and emotional intelligence.</p><h2><span id=Responsibilities>Responsibilities</span></h2><p>She would provide New Yorkers with the protection and justice they deserve. She would wake up every day with a laser-focused day, keeping track of the city’s safety and improvement. During the meeting, Sewell made a strong impression on Adams. She defeated numerous other contenders, including Carmen Best, a former Seattle police chief. Adams, a former NYPD captain, vowed to hire Sewell as commissioner; the department has also hired others for other positions. The Police Benevolent Association welcomed Sewell to the second most difficult policing job in the United States. They claimed that it is the most difficult since, as a member of the NYPD, you must be on the streets at all times.</p><h2><span id=Keechant_Sewell8217s_Net_worth>Keechant Sewell’s Net worth</span></h2><p>In New York, the basic pay grade or compensation of the Police Commissioner is usually $196,998. This is over 30% more than the national average remuneration for a commissioner. <strong>She has also been serving the country for more than two decades, therefore her net worth is likely to be in the $2 million range.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Keechant Sewell estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

There is no information available about whether she married or had any previous relationships. As a result, we presume she prefers to preserve the privacy of her problems to herself. She appears to be entirely concerned with her duties and the fulfillment of her responsibilities.</p><h2><span id=Announcement>Announcement</span></h2><p>The legal pronouncement was made on Wednesday morning at the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City, where Adams spoke. She will be the third black person to lead the NYPD, following Benjamin Ward and Lee Brown in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. Killing, shooting, and the proliferation of firearms have become a nationwide norm in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Police officials have attempted to alter pretrial confinement for a variety of offenses. There is minimal evidence that these improvements would increase crime. The announcement comes after it was reported that the current NYPD commissioner, Dermot Shea, and the department’s second-in-command, First Deputy Commissioner Benjamin Tucker, will complete his entire term and retire at the end of this year.</p><p>The police commissioners would be compelled to provide 30 days notice in advance. Adams, a former captain from the New York Police Department, was tasked with selecting a replacement. On April 16, 2018, a 28-year-old veteran of the NYPD was promoted to Chief of Detectives, before the commissioner’s (Shea) job. Shea was the Chief of Crime Control Strategies before becoming Chief of Detectives. His job was to examine city-wide crime and trends to design crime-control policies and procedures. Shea served as Deputy Commissioner of Operations for more than four years.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>police officer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Know About Franklin Thomas Fox- Wiki, Net Worth, Wife, Daughter</a></h3>The most prominent claim to fame for Franklin is that he is the father of American actress and model Megan Fox.
