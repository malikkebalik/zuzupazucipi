I’m saying this for the last time. I don’t know this person. I’ve never been with this person. So please stop with the continuous cyber games and the fictional storytelling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-blue-dress-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Soon after the hitmaker denied the allegations, Rojean then took to her Instagram Story to say counter Travis’ statement, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Shade Room</a>. “Ok, what we’re not gonna do is lie on me,” the Instagram model said. “I pretended I didn’t know you and went along with every f***ing narrative you guys wanted.” She went on to claim that the father-of-two “definitely” has “been with” her and that “everyone” has seen them together. The brunette also claimed that she allegedly has photos and videos of her with Travis and said that he “cheats on that b****” every night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kylie and Travis have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been dating</a> since 2017 and briefly broke up in 2019.
