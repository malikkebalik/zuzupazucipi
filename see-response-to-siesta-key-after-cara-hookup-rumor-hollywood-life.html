In her tweet, Juliette claimed that her co-star, <strong>Cara Geswelli</strong>, had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheated on</a> boyfriend,&nbsp;<strong>Garrett Miller</strong>, with Johnny during a trip to Cancun in March 2019. She said that she found out about the alleged hookup from&nbsp;Floribama Shore star,&nbsp;<strong>Nilsa Prowant</strong>, who was also on the spring break Cancun trip. For the first several hours after the message was posted, Johnny kept quiet, but by the evening of Jan. 7, he weighed in himself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>‚ÄúIs there a drought in South Florida because these #SiestaKey kids are thiiiiiirstaaaay,‚Äù Bananas wrote. He did not directly address the rumors that he ‚Äúf***ed‚Äù Cara. However, during the Jan. 7 premiere of&nbsp;Siesta Key, Juliette and her BFF,&nbsp;<strong>Kelsey Owens</strong>, seemingly stood by the accusation on Twitter. In one scene of the premiere, which was filmed in summer 2019, Garrett surprised Cara with chocolates and flowers, and as it aired, Kelsey tweeted, ‚Äú[Garrett] you should‚Äôve brought her bananas.‚Äù She even tagged Johnny in the tweet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile, Juliette stood up for Kelsey on Twitter when a scene aired that showed Cara talking badly about her. ‚ÄúCara, honey, jealousy doesn‚Äôt look good on you,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúHence why I tweeted that Cara was a shady skank last night.‚Äù Cara has not responded to the accusations abut her alleged hookup with Johnny Bananas, and did not post about the&nbsp;Siesta Key premiere on social media. Clearly, she knows where she stands with the rest of the cast!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Is there a drought in South Florida because these <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#SiestaKey</a> kids are thiiiiiiirstaaay ü•µ</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>‚Äî Johnny Bananas (@johnnybananas) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 8, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cara and Garrett, who also used to date Kelsey, got together during season two of Siesta Key, which was filmed during the summer of 2018.
