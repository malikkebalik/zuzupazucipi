They’re best friends with Nick Viall.&nbsp;</strong><br>Haley and Emily met<strong> Nick Viall</strong>, 36, while filming&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise season 3. They became fast friends. Emily called Nick one of the “greatest guys” she knows in a super sweet Instagram post before his season of The Bachelor premiered.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3.&nbsp;Both girls auditioned to be Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders!</strong><br>Before they competed for<strong> Ben Higgins’</strong> heart on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Bachelor</a>, they appeared on the reality show&nbsp;Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team. They didn’t make the team, but it was for the best! They have their own show now!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>4. They’re probably not going to show up on a Bachelor Nation show again.</strong><br>Both Emily and Haley are moving on from Bachelor Nation now that they’ve got their gig on Happily Ever After? on Freeform. It’s not that they don’t love the franchise, they just don’t see it fitting into their lives — right now.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I just really feel like going back on The Bachelor wouldn’t be for us or even Bachelor in Paradise,” Emily told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ScreenerTV</a>. “Where we’re at right now, we’re just really happy with what we’re doing and everything in our lives. I really don’t think that’s something we’ve been thinking about at all.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>5. Before they became reality stars, they were studying to become teachers!</strong><br>While they were on The Bachelor, Emily and Haley were in school to become <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>elementary school teachers</a>. On Emily’s University of Nevada Las Vegas coursework page, she said she wanted to become a teacher because she loves kids and wants to “help them learn and grow.” It appears both Emily and Haley have taken a break from their studies to focus on The Twins: Happily Ever After? and their blog.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The Twins: Happily Ever After? season 2 premieres March 20 at 9 p.m. ET on Freeform.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you going to watch The Twins: Happily Ever After?
