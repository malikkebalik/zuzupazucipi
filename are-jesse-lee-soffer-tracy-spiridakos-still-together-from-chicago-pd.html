The real-life Chicago P.D. couple are notoriously private, though, so it‚Äôs hard to tell what their relationship status currently is. <a href=# rel=noopener>Are Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos still together</a>? We have the answer below.</p><p>Soffer and Spiridakos co-starred alongside each other on Chicago P.D.&nbsp;for seven seasons. Soffer was an original cast member and played Detective Jay Halstead for the first 10 seasons, while Spiridakos came on board in Season 4 as Detective Hailey Upton. Their characters were partners who eventually fell in love and got married. Soffer <a href=# rel=noopener>left the show</a> to pursue other opportunities in 2022, inevitably ending Upstead for good. Spiridakos will soon follow suit and is <a href=# rel=noopener>set to exit</a> at the end of Season 11.</p><p>In January 2024, the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York Post</a> confirmed that the co-stars had been secretly dating in real life. Soffer and Spiridakos have yet to confirm their relationship themselves and they have no spoken publicly about each other. Since it‚Äôs now been several months since the news of their relationship broke, fans are wondering if they‚Äôre still together. Keep reading for an update on Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos‚Äô off-screen relationship.</p><h2>Are Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos still together?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5.-Jesse-Lee-Soffer-and-Tracy-Tracy-Spiridakos-Chicago-P.D.jpg alt="Jesse Lee Soffer, Tracy Spiridakos" width=1231 height=718 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Are Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos still together? While Upstead may be officially over, fans can rest assured knowing that Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos are still together in real life.</p><p>Spirdakos confirmed that she and Soffer were still together in an Instagram post a week before the Chicago P.D. Season 12 of a photo of her and Soffer on set. Soffer directed the penultimate episode of Season 12, ‚ÄúInventory,‚Äù which Spiridakos called attention to. ‚ÄúTonight‚Äôs episode was directed by the one and only, our very own @jesseleesoffer ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥!! And you guys, it‚Äôs a realllllllly good one. You don‚Äôt want to miss it,‚Äù she captioned a carousel of photos of her and her boyfriend on set.</p><p>On April 23, 2024, Spiridakos also took to Instagram to celebrate her former co-star and boyfriend‚Äôs milestone 40th birthday. Alongside a selfie of the two of them, the actress wrote: ‚ÄúHAPPY BIRTHDAY @jesseleesoffer ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥.‚Äù Fans flooded the comments section of the post, with one fan writing: ‚ÄúOH MY GOD ü•πü•πü•π,‚Äù while another commented, ‚ÄúMY H[E]ART STOPPED.‚Äù</p><p>The month prior, Spiridakos shared another photo of Soffer when he <a href=# rel=noopener>returned to the NBC procedural</a> to direct an episode of Season 11. ‚ÄúThis is what happens when you leave your phone unattended around here‚Ä¶.‚Äù she captioned the post, which included a selfie of Soffer and producer Brian Luce, as well as several other shots of the cast and crew.</p><p>While Soffer and Spiridakos appear to be going strong, the same cannot be said for Jay Halstead and Hailey Upton. Halstead left the CPD back in Season 10 to investigate the cartel in Bolivia and abruptly ended Upstead when he stopped returning his wife‚Äôs calls. In the Season 11 premiere, viewers learned that both Halstead and Upton had signed divorce papers, but the latter was struggling to take the final step and mail them in. By the end of the episode, however, Upton finally worked up the courage and dropped them off. Showrunner Gwen Sigan also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Insider</a> in January 2024 that the couple are ‚Äúofficially divorced.‚Äù</p><p>It is still unclear <a href=# rel=noopener>how Upton will be written off</a>, but it‚Äôs very unlikely that she and Halstead will reconcile before she goes. While speaking to <a href=# rel=noopener>TVLine</a> ahead of the season premiere, Sigan shared that there were no plans of bringing Soffer back on-screen and noted that Upton will find ‚Äúclosure‚Äù when it comes to her divorce. ‚ÄúI do think that we‚Äôre going to see Upton deal with a lot of what happened last year with the fallout and find her way through it and find her way out to the other side ‚Äî and to a better side for her character,‚Äù Sigan told the outlet.</p><p>Chicago P.D.&nbsp; streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Chicago P.D., check out this gallery to see <a href=# rel=noopener>where the alums of the show are now</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmyAc4WOo5ysq5ViuaaxjKymn56Vp3q1vsCcsGaroJ6%2FqrDApKasZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
