The opening lines, "I bet your mother would be proud of you, ooh, I bet our mother would be proud of you, oh," imply a sarcastic tone, highlighting the singer's dissatisfaction with their partner's behavior. Drake suggests that he believes he treated his partner well, despite her claims otherwise. He criticizes her for making assumptions and drawing conclusions without valid evidence, comparing her as having a "Parsons degree" in expertise.</p><br><p>The chorus reveals the singer's desire for a genuine connection rather than a compromising relationship fueled by unrealistic fantasies. Drake expresses his willingness to go to great lengths for love, emphasizing that he will move mountains for genuine affection, not social status. The repeated invitation to "lean in to me" indicates his longing for emotional intimacy and vulnerability.</p><br><p>Drake then delves into more specific examples of his past relationship. He characterizes his partner as both pretty and rough, comparing her to Virginia Beach, which is both beautiful and known for its gritty elements. He reminisces about the time they spent together, longing to return to the days when his partner loved him for who he was, not for material possessions. However, he acknowledges that their relationship was not without pain and wants to get back to the "major league," where their connection was stronger. Drake confronts his partner with the fact that she was attracted to another man who spent money on her, but ultimately she gave the car he bought her back to Drake.</p><br><p>In the following verse, Drake addresses the tensions and arguments present in their relationship. He uses a metaphor of a fencing match to describe their texting dynamic, highlighting the tension between them. He comments on her repetitive use of the word "period," implying that she fails to back up her claims or express her true feelings. Drake also mentions introducing her to his friends' girlfriends, but she shows no interest in building relationships with them. He proposes that she focuses on her culinary skills, referencing her ability to bake rather than trying to make amends through cooking for him. Drake reveals that their relationship has become suffocating and expresses his desire to know the person he fell in love with again. He warns any man who dares to come between them and hints at the possibility of starting a family with her. Despite her claims that he could have treated her better, Drake maintains that he did what he could and has no regrets.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line
