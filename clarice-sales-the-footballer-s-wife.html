Her husband’s achievement has led to a huge net worth. As of December 2022, he was valued<strong> at $15 million.</strong></p><h2><span id=Her_future_husband_was_buried_there>Her future husband was buried there</span></h2><p>When Clarice was 11, her parents bought a grocery store in Bicas, Brazil. Danilo’s mother’s neighbor cared for her grandparents. They attended the lady’s grandson’s funeral.</p><p>Danilo attended his own burial. Clarice and Danilo started talking there. They learned they went to the same high school and the player was two years older. They started dating after several years.</p><h2><span id=She_married_her_perfect_boyfriend_after_seven_years_of_dating>She married her perfect boyfriend after seven years of dating</span></h2><p>Clarice and Danilo dated from 2010 to 2017. Their wedding was on June 30, 2017. Clarice has traveled the world with her footballer boyfriend since he began his career. Clarice is a loving wife and mother to her two children. Two kids. Their oldest was born in 2015 and their youngest in 2019.</p><h2><span id=Her_football-playing_hubby>Her football-playing hubby</span></h2><p>Her husband is from Bicas, Minas Gerais. He grew up watching his football-star father. His father ingrained football in him. His father, who couldn’t pursue his passion, saw it in him.</p><p>He paved the way by requesting a trial with Tupynambas, which he got. In 2009, he made his professional debut with America Mineiro before moving to Santos. He helped Santos beat Penarol 2-1 in the 2011 Copa Libertadores final.</p><p>Danilo played 90% of the game in midfield and was Santos’ second-leading scorer behind Neymar, which gave him the confidence he could play there. The goal was vital to the club and represented the finish of a project for him and the team, he said. His performance attracted elite clubs.</p><p>He played in the 2011 FIFA Under-20 World Cup in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He’s on Tite’s World Cup and Copa America rosters. Previously with Porto, Real Madrid, and Manchester City. He won the Champions League in 2016 and 2017.</p><h2><span id=Danilo>Danilo</span></h2><p>Chewing bothers him. He begs them to stop because he’s annoyed. His biggest fear is alienating his sons. In his youth, he sold candy for two weeks. He hates it. Will Smith would be his celebrity dinner choice.</p><p>His favorite athlete is Usain Bolt. He also likes footvolley. He likes Porshe. His childhood favorite was Pokemon. As a child, he almost burned down his house by igniting oil.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Milly Alcock Plays Rhaenyra Targaryen In “House of the Dragon”</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Thomas Lemar- Wiki, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfmLmivsicnGarkaGytHnToZxmnp%2BkwaOty6Wcq6tdrLansY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
