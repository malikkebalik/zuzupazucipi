According to DRAM, Drake didn’t do anything, and his security handled the issue instead.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Aye somebody tell Drake to shut the fuck up about that shit, man,” DRAM said. “Fucking five years ago. This n-gga never touched me n-gga. I pressed his ass. His fucking bodyguards, God damn, I ain’t gonna hold you, his bodyguards went to town on the kid, but his bodyguards did it, not his bitch ass. He ain’t touch me. He’s a bitch, you know that.”</p><p>He continued: “Why I gotta get into all of that? When I see him, I’ma see him. I’m saying what’s good with the one-on-one though, my baby? What’s up my n-gga? But he don’t wanna do that. You want to have your guards. That’s cool though. He ain’t touch me, though and that shit from five years ago, come on, n-gga. Why are you bringing that up? Why don’t you talk about how you got smacked by Diddy?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woke up to some fuck shit smh <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TGar1PbBDz</a></p><p>— DRAM back (@shelleysaid) <a href=#>November 4, 2022</a></p><p>The situation between these two likely kicked off when DRAM released “Cha Cha” in 2015. The record was a hit single that landed DRAM a deal with Atlantic and saw him get co-signs from Beyoncé and Drake.</p><p>However, things got interesting when Drizzy dropped “Hotline Bling,” a record similar to DRAM’s “Cha Cha.” The similarities between the two tracks were so undeniable that DRAM felt Drake bit his style.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a>, DRAM revealed how he felt about Drake’s “Hotline Bling” and how other people saw the swagger jacking that was allegedly happening.</p><p>“I feel like my record got jacked,” DRAM told Billboard. “And it’s not just me. People been comparing ‘Cha Cha’ and ‘Hotline Bling’ since it came out.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/11/drake-kanye-west-circo-loco-diss-j-prince-response-250x142.png alt="Kanye West & Drake's Beef Threatens To Reignite After 'Her Loss' Jab" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Kanye West & Drake's Beef Threatens To Reignite After 'Her Loss' Jab</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 4, 2022</p></a><p>DRAM wasn’t the only person that caught a stray from the 6 God on Her Loss.&nbsp;<a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion</a> had words for Drake as well after the OVO hitmaker seemingly sniped her in his opening verse on “Circo Loso,” suggesting <a class=underline-link href=#>she lied about Tory Lanez shooting her</a>.</p><p>“This bitch lie about getting shots, but she still she a stallion/ She don’t even get the joke, but she still smiling,” he raps.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Megan didn’t take too kindly to the perceived diss and fired back at Drake on Twitter shortly after the album’s midnight release.</p><p>“Stop using my shooting for clout bitch ass N-ggas!
