They were characters very close to reality, almost all of them had a Kim or a Nikki in their family.</p><p class=dh>The situations that were presented in the episodes were not only funny, they were also quite attached to what a royal family was going through at the time, which helped increase their popularity.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>CANCELED WITHOUT EXPLANATION</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite "Moesha's" success, the series was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://screenrant.com/moesha-season-7-canceled-reason-renewal-updates/>suddenly canceled.</a> The production claimed that the ratings had dropped a lot. However, there were several questions to be resolved and it would not be unreasonable to think of a reboot of the series.</p><p class=dh>Some of the unresolved questions, like who the positive pregnancy test belonged to or what happened to Moesha's brother Myles, were left unsolved.
