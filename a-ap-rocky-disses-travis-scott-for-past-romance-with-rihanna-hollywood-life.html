A$AP took the stage at the Rolling Loud music festival in Miami on July 23 and sang an unreleased track with lyrics that fans think were shady towards Travis. “First you stole my flow, so I stole your b**** / Then you stole my style, I need at least like 10 percent /All due disrespect, I hope you take offense,” A$AP rapped during his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>performance</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“First you stole my flow so I stole your bitch, then you stole my style I need my 10% all the disrespect I hope you take a offense” -ASAP Rocky</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>🤔🤔🤔</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/L1hKWaZEAH</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Ahmed/The Ears/IG: BigBizTheGod 🇸🇴 (@big_business_) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 24, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Fans took to Twitter to share their theories that A$AP was dissing Travis with those lyrics. “Travis Scott Vs Asap Rocky is pay per view worthy,” one fan<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> tweeted</a>. Another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a>, “Cooked Travis.” A third fan shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> of a stampede of people rushing down an escalator, with the caption, “Travis Scott fans running to the comments.” Travis hasn’t responded to A$AP’s apparent diss yet. Maybe he’ll do so in a new song? We can only hope.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asap-rocky-Travis-Scott-Rihanna-romance-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before Rihanna found love with A$AP, she had <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a brief fling</a> with Travis back in 2015. The former couple were first spotted together at New York Fashion Week and it was quickly reported that the pair were “officially” together. Rihanna and Travis even collaborated on the 2015 rap track “B**** Better Have My Money.” Nevertheless, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the relationship</a> was short lived, but Travis did go on to serve as the opening act on Ri’s 2016 Anti World Tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After their breakup, Travis went on to date&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> starting in 2017. They welcomed two children together, daughter&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stormi Webster</strong></a>, 5, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aire Webster</strong></a>, 1, during their years-long, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on-and-off relationship</a>. Their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>latest split</a> happened in late 2022. A$AP, meanwhile, has been dating Rihanna since 2020, after they were friends for years. Rihanna <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth to the couple’s first child</a> together in May 2022 and she announced her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second pregnancy</a> during her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 Super Bowl Halftime performance.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asap-rocky-Travis-Scott-Rihanna-romance-spl-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A$AP and Rihanna</a> have been laying low this summer while they await the birth of their second child. One of the last times they were seen in public together was at A$AP’s concert at Spotify Beach at Cannes Lions event on June 21. A$AP called the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnant superstar</a> his <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“wife”</a> during his performance, which led to fans thinking that the couple may have gotten <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secretly married</a>. Rihanna was there at the concert cheering her man on from the audience, while showing off her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gorgeous baby bump</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FuZpqrkaV6s7vCpLBmnJmowKa%2FjK2pmq6ZqHq0r86tq2arn6O0br7IoZinppFiw6qwxKhm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
