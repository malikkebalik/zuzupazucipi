Dolph Ziggler, who is also a wrestler and Nikki, started seeing each other at the end of the year and their love life bloomed for nearly two years. Dolph, 38, had some serious issues of Nikki being closer with another guy. Actually, it was not as Nikki was frank and friendly with all people around. The real reason of the duo’s breakup must be the misunderstanding.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nick_Nemeth_and_Nikki_Bella></span>Nick Nemeth and Nikki Bella<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Soon after separating from Dolph, Nikki appeared together with a fellow wrestler, <strong>Nick Nemeth</strong>, in the year 2009.
