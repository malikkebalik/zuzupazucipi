This innovative way to set the mood was made possible by ES Smokebusters. The company creates custom leaf blowers attached to strainers which are then filled with a hefty amount of psychoactive drugs and lit with blowtorches.&nbsp;</p><p>The music fest was soon surrounded by massive plumes of marijuana smoke with all the weed heads enjoying the beat of the music. The 21-and-over crowd was more than okay with the gray clouds emerging as audible cheering was noticeable in surfaced videos. The event took place at the Adelanto Plaza & Event Center which also featured a <a href=#>car</a> show. While the news was snatched as a top story, the 42-year-old Redondo Beach native took to his social media to say a few words and publicize the whole festivity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'USA is officially lit': Internet flooded with memes as Biden pardons thousands convicted of marijuana possession</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Drew Barrymore was allowed to smoke weed and drink alcohol at 9 but here's why her mom banned sugar!</a></p><p>"Fuck a fog machine we had @elite_solution and @essmokebusters on deck last night at Kushstock in Adelanto nothing but vibes all day mad love," the rapper thanked ES Smokebusters for coming through with their custom leaf blowers.

A fan commented, "Made it on TMZ and everything!." Another posted, "Such a vibe love u daddy. Straight killed it. Canâ€™t wait for the next." "I just heard Louis from the family guy laughing in here," the third comment read. Fans were mainly happy with the rapper scoring headlines in TMZ. "This was on TMZ! Chucky Chuck going viral across the internet while #Dbroke is playing to half empty dive bars," another fan commented.&nbsp;</p><p>California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996. States such as Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota, and South Dakota are now voting to decide whether to legalize adult use of the drug in next month's midterm elections. A total of 19 states and two Union territories and Washington, DC have permitted the use of marijuana in small amounts. The psychoactive drug is, however, not legal in many other states.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGlvaa%2BjJyfrpubrnqktNScomaanJbAtb%2BMsJyenF2ourC3xGauoqyYYrC2v9OopGabkaO7oq7IrGScmZ6jvK95yKerqGWbqsCpv9OomqRllprAtbXVmqNmm6KkxKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
