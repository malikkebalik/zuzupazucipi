The general weather in Ireland will always keep the bowlers a little intrigued with chances of rain in between the encounter likely. Here, the bounce is consistent and true, allowing the batsmen to play their shots with no restraint.</p><p>On 26th June, Sunday at 4.30 PM local time (9 PM IST), the game will begin. At this time, it is expected to be between 12 and 17 degrees Celsius, and rain is expected to fall for a few hours at a healthy 1.9 millimeter pace. As a result, the match may be slightly shortened as teams monitor the DLS calculations. The percentage rate for predicting rain is 17%.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The pitch has hosted 14 matches so far out of which the team batting first won 6 matches. Meanwhile, the team chasing the target has won remaining eight times. Hosts Ireland haven‚Äôt performed good at this ground as they have only won 2 games in this pitch and lost majority of games. The first batting team‚Äôs average score is 162 and hence, 180 score for the first batting team should be challenging for team batting second.</p><h4><strong>Latest Match Results at Malahide Cricket Club</strong></h4><p>South Africa defeated Ireland by 33 runs in the most recent T20I played at the Malahide Cricket Club Ground.
