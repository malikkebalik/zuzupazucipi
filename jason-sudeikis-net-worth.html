That is how much money he has earned from his numerous roles on TV shows and in movies. Additionally, Jason Sudeikis net worth comes from his other jobs such as voice actor, screenwriter and comedian. Sudeikis is most famous for his appearances in “Saturday Night Live” which he first joined as a writer but later started to come out on screen, too. His other TV roles include such popular shows as “30 Rock”, “The Cleveland Show” and “Eastbound and Down”, while the movies he starred in are “Horrible Bosses”, “Epic”, “Hall Pass” and “We’re the Millers”.</p><h3>Jason Sudeikis Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Jason Sudeikis was born in 1975 in Fairfax, Virginia, USA. Jason, who is of mixed Irish, German and Lithuanian origin, grew up in Kansas as his family moved there when he was still a child. It seems like this city remained important to Sudeikis as it plays important role in his comic writing. Jason’s career began when he became a member of a comedy group called “ComedySportz” and that also took place in Kansas. To advance his career he later moved to Chicago where he joined several other comedy groups such as ImprovOlympics, pright Citizens Brigade and Second City Las Vegas, before he was hired as a writer for the Saturday Night Live. That happened in 2003 and two years later Jason advanced to become full cast member. This job which he kept on doing until 2013 contributed much to the growth of Jason Sudeikis net worth.</p><p>Besides his work in “Saturday Night Live” Jason Sudeikis is also well known for his other roles. One of those is his appearance in a TV series “30 Rock” where he starred along with another star <a href=#>Tina Fey</a>. Later on Sudeikis turned into film more and more, appearing in Hollywood comedies such as “What happens in Vegas” and “The Bounty Hunter”, alongside such starts as <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>. James’s probably biggest hit so far was his role in a comedy movie “Horrible Bosses, directed by Seth Gordon and released in 2011. In this movie Jason appeared together with many famous actors including <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=#>Kevin Spacey</a>, <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a>, <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>, <a href=#>Charlie Day</a> and others. His next film brought Sudeikis his first leading role and that was in a film called “Hall Pass” made by <a href=#>Farrelly Brothers</a> and which was again a comedy. All these roles helped Jason Sudeikis to grow his net worth but it looks like in the future he will become even more rich. That is thanks to his appearance in a 2013 movie “Drinking Buddies” as well as “We’re the Millers”, and of course an upcoming sequel “Horrible Bosses2”.</p><p>Jason Sudeikis has been married to an actress and a fellow writer on the ‘Saturday Night Live’ Kay Cannon but the couple divorced in 2010. Currently he is engaged to an actress <a href=#>Olivia Wilde</a> and they already have a newborn baby boy.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.060013956734><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jason Sudeikis</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 18, 1975</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fairfax, Virginia, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Comedian, Voice Actor, Screenwriter</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>Brookridge Elementary School, Fort Scott Community College, Rockhurst High School, Shawnee Mission West High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Kay Cannon (m. 2004–2010)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Otis Alexander Sudeikis, Daisy Josephine Sudeikis</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Kathryn Sudeikis, Dan Sudeikis</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Kristin Sudeikis, Lindsay Sudeikis</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Olivia Wilde (2011–)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Daniel Jason Sudeikis , Suds</td></tr><tr readability=0.23188405797101><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jason-Sudeikis/109360219090729</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28571428571429><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/jason_sudeikis?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32142857142857><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/jason_sudeikis/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/63644967</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837177</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27118644067797><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/jason-sudeikis-mn0002586184</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>“ComedySportz”</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nominations</td><td>People's Choice Award for Favorite Movie Duo, MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance, Teen Choice Award for Choice Hissy Fit (2014), MTV Movie Awards (2015)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>"Hall Pass" (2011), "Horrible Bosses" (2011), "Epic" (2013), "We're the Millers" (2013), "Horrible Bosses 2" (2014), "The Angry Birds Movie" (2016), "Race" (2016)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Saturday Night Live" (2003-2017), "30 Rock", "The Cleveland Show"(2009-2013), "Eastbound & Down" (2012-2013), "The Last Man on Earth" (2015-2016), "Son of Zorn" (2016-present)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=38.708611599297><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7.3655172413793><td>1</td><td>[on Feb 5, 2016 in L.A.
