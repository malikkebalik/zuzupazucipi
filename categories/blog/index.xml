この格付けでの二人の仲の行方が気になります。
そして、この日「ＷＥＡＲＥＸ」公式ツイッターで「『芸能人格付けチェック！これぞ真の一流品だ！２０１８正月スペシャル』に最強チーム『ＹＯＳＨＩＫＩ＆ＧＡＣＫＴ』が登場！最強チームで、絶対に間違えられない戦いに挑みます。どうぞお楽しみに！」の告知が。

GacktさんとYOSHIKIさんが、
共通して強いのはワインの問題だと思います。
YOSHIKIさんは基本的にシャンパンを好みますが、
ワインの味にだって精通しています。
これまでワインの問題はGacktさんが挑んでいましたが、
今回は、初めてYOSHIKIさんを信用して任せる可能性もあります。
さらに言えばクラシック音楽やジャズの問題も、
YOSHIKIさんがいれば最強と言えることでしょう。
もっと言えば、生まれも育ちも良いYOSHIKIさんだけに、
盆栽などの高貴な問題にも強そうです。
ある意味Gacktさんの弱点を補えそうに思えます。
しかし、ワインも音楽も強い二人が、
仮に意見が割れてしまったら、
どちらかが譲ることができるのか？
そこが一番怖いところです。
YOSHIKIさんもGacktさんもプライドが高く、
どちらも譲らない性格なので、
得意分野で答えが別れないことを祈りましょう。
・・・流石にYOSHIKIさんクラスなら、
Gacktさんが譲る場面もありえそうですが、
仮にそれで正解したら、格付け史上最高の名場面になることでしょう。
SKIN再結成と友情・関係(画像・動画) YOSHIKIさんとGacktさんと言えば、
やはり２００７年のスキンの活動が気になります。
二人の各方面の話を聞いてる限りは、
今後やる予定はないが、プロジェクトは生きてるそうです。
この前のネット方法の中で、
YOSHIKIさんの方からGacktさんに、
スキンの話をしていたのが意外でした。
そして、その時のGacktさんの、
やや複雑な表情が・・・・。</description></item><item><title>Are Jesse Lee Soffer, Tracy Spiridakos Still Together From Chicago PD?</title><link>/are-jesse-lee-soffer-tracy-spiridakos-still-together-from-chicago-pd.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/are-jesse-lee-soffer-tracy-spiridakos-still-together-from-chicago-pd.html</guid><description>All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors.
