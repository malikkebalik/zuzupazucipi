It sounds like Eminem is really digging deep to figure out why he’s taken aim at Iggy,&nbsp;<strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, <strong>Britney Spears</strong> and other&nbsp;huge female stars in his music. Could it be he’s trying to stay relevant by dissing some of the biggest names in the business?</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Either way, his new lyrics are a far cry from, “Put that s*** away Iggy. You don’t wanna blow that rape whistle on me. Scream! I love it” — and we’re happy about that. “Guts Over Fear” is the real Slim Shady at his best.</p><h3>Iggy Azalea Dissed Eminem In Her AMAs Acceptance Speech</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>As <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> previously reported, Iggy was furious when she heard Eminem’s offensive lyrics, and she took to Twitter on Nov. 20 to put him in his place, saying:</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>im bored of the old men threatening young women as entertainment trend and much more interested in the young women getting $ trend. zzzz</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 20, 2014</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>its especially akward because my 14 year old brother is the biggest eminem fan and now the artist he admired says he wants to rape me. nice! — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 20, 2014</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>women in music have the bigger balls anyhow we endure much more harassment and critic. good morninnggggg!!!!!! off to camera block for AMAs!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 20, 2014</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>So what do YOU think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
