He was most active throughout the ‘80s, when he became known as one of the better hitting pitchers of his era. He was voted the NL Rookie of the Year, and won the Cy Young Award in 1981, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers win the World Series. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, California Angels, Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Fernando Valenzuela is? According to sources it has been estimated that Valenzuela’s net worth is over $6 million, accumulated largely during his successful and lucrative 20 years-long professional baseball career, during which he recorded impressive results. Having played in six famous baseball teams, his popularity and net worth significantly increased.</p><h3>Fernando Valenzuela Net Worth $6 Million</h3><p>Valenzuela was born the youngest of twelve children in the family. He began his professional baseball career in 1977 with the Mayos de Navojoa, and the following year, he transferred to the Guanajuato Tuzos of the Mexican Central League. A year later, this team became a part of the expanded Liga Mexicana de Beisbol (Mexican Baseball League), which resulted in Fernando elevating to the Triple A level. During this period, numerous MLB teams scouted Valenzuela, and he eventually signed a $120.000 contract with the LA Dodgers in July 1979. However, Fernando only truly caught the attention of the public while pitching for the Dodgers in the 1981 opening game, and he finished the season with a record of 13 wins and 7 losses and further held the record also in completed games, innings pitched, strikeouts and shutouts. He was named NL Rookie of the Year and became the first rookie to win the Cy Young Award. In addition, he led the Dodgers to the World Series title. His net worth was certainly well established.<br>Fernando became so popular that there was a phenomenon known as “Fernandomania”, due to the increase of fans attendance whenever he pitched in road games. At the same time, he became a cultural icon of the Latino community in the US and a hero in Mexico. His eventual career record was 173 wins and 153 losses. During his career, Valenzuela spent 11 years playing in the major leagues with the Dodgers and also played with the California Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres.</p><p>Apart from his US league career, Fernando spent three seasons pitching in the Mexican League, and several more in the Mexican Pacific League. In 2003, he joined the Dodger’s Spanish-language broadcast team to work as a commentator for National League West games. Twelve years later, he switched to commentating on the Spanish-language feed of SportsNet L.A. He was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in August 2003, and became a member of the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><p>When it comes to his private life, Valenzuela has been married to Linda Burgos since 1981, and the couple has four children. One of his sons, Fernando, Jr. played as the first baseman in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox organizations.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.4662309368192><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Fernando Valenzuela</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 1, 1960</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Navojoa, Mexico</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>88 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Mexican</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Linda Valenzuela</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Fernando Valenzuela Jr., Linda Valenzuela, Ricardo Valenzuela, Maria Fernanda Valenzuela</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Hermenegilda Anguamea de Valenzuela, Avelino Valenzuela</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Siblings</td><td>Rafael Anguamea Valenzuela</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2463036/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>National League Cy Young Award</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Led the National League in Wins (21) in 1986.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>2</td><td>Led the National League in Innings Pitched (192 1/3), Strikeouts (180), Games Started (25) and Shutouts (8) in 1981.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>Led the National League in Complete Games in 1981 (11), 1986 (20) and 1987 (12).</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=8><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>I Love Jenni</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>30 for 30</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Bluetopia: The LA Dodgers Movie</td><td>2009</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Baseball Bunch</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1986 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>1986</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - NL Pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>1985 National League Championship Series</td><td>1985</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Los Angeles Dodgers Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>1985 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>1985</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - NL Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>1984 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>1984</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - NL Pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>1983 National League Championship Series</td><td>1983</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Los Angeles Dodgers Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>1982 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>1982</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - NL Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>People of the Year</td><td>1982</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1981 World Series</td><td>1981</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - Los Angeles Dodgers Pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>1981 National League Championship Series</td><td>1981</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Los Angeles Dodgers Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>1981 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>1981</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - NL Pitcher</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp%2Bcq6aRo7GwedWao56mqqqyra2Mp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
