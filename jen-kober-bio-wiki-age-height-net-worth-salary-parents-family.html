This is what she has to say about it:</p><p>“Why is the word MARRIAGE so important to you? You know you have a 55 percent divorce rate? I am married to my wife. We are not partners, girlfriends, roommates or experimenting. Deal with it. Start saying it. We are people. Just like you. We fell in love and we want to get MARRIED. We were raised with the same hopes of getting MARRIED that you were. When I get EQUAL rights and terminology then the problem will be solved and not a moment before.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jen_Kober_Net_Worth></span>Jen Kober Net Worth <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thanks to Jen Kober’s career, she was able to garner a decent sum by making people laugh.
