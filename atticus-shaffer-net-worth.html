With some appearances in movies, and the prospect of more opportunities as his career moves on, this might be just the beginning for young Atticus.</p><h3>Atticus Shaffer Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Atticus started his career when he was discovered in 2006, when his first opportunity came as a guest star in the television show “The Class”. His performance landed him the lead role for the show “The Middle”, which was the real start of his rise in net worth. Soon after, he found himself starring in other television shows as a guest, being featured in shows including “My Name is Earl”, “Days of Our Lives”, and “Carpoolers”. He also received some opportunities in films, such as a support role in the movie “Hancock” in which he had a scene with <a href=#>Will Smith, </a>and has also starred in the films “The Unborn”, “Leaving Barstow” and “Opposite Day”. He took parts in various commercials, and then was given the idea of doing voice-overs for animated movies and films – he’s voiced for titles like “Frankenweenie”, “Subject: I Love You” and “Year One”. He’s also working for the animated television show “Fish Hooks” which has been on air since 2010.

He also enjoys watching and reading anything from the Star Wars Franchise. Aside from these, he watches a lot of the History Channel, such as the shows “The Pickers” and “Storage Wars”. Atticus also loves camping and does his best to earn merits and badges. He also doesn’t take his fame too seriously; at times he says that he isn’t used to people talking about him or looking at him. He thinks of his career as an inspiration for people like him, and those that look up to him as a role-model. He currently resides in Acton, California.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.372340425532><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Atticus Shaffer</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$4 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 19, 1998</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa Clarita, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>4' 7" (1.4 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Debbie Shaffer, Ron Shaffer</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Atticus W.
