The trailer's debut at the Oscars is now all over the Internet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ensemble</a>&nbsp;includes stars like Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Corey Stoll, Brian d'Arcy James, and Curtiss Cook, as well as Rita Moreno, who was one of the cast members of the original movie adaptation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreno&nbsp;had initially won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Anita in the original movie&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">adaptation</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Spielberg and Kushner were insistent on correcting some of the flaws of the 1961 movie, which had gotten a lot of things wrong but also had some factors right, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>&nbsp;Monero. She also readdressed the fact that she was one of the very few Puerto Ricans in the cast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"That's what they were trying to fix and ameliorate, and I think they have done an incredible job," says Monero. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Moreover, the plot is roughly based on William Shakespeare's&nbsp;Romeo and Juliet&nbsp;- as there are a couple of&nbsp;teenagers, Tony and Maria, who fall in love in 1950s New York City. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, they are affiliated with rival street gangs. The characters are played by Elgort and Zegler, respectively.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Vanity Fair, Spielberg asserted that the cast brought authenticity to the movie.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The director believes that all represent a diversity that spanned through the Puerto Rican, Nuyorican community, and the broader Latinx community.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer makes it seem and feel more like your average Spielberg movie and not a musical. The trailer emphasizes the Jets vs. Sharks rivalry and hurriedly insinuates the romance between Tony and Maria.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Spielberg's potential inclination into the dramatical aspects would certainly help distinguish his rendition from the original. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nevertheless, fans of the musical shouldn't expect the new adaptation to be absolutely destitute of the anticipated musical elements.</p><p>In fact, producers Disney might even be attempting to portray West Side Story as more of a drama so that it would generate buzz at next year's Oscars.</p><p>With Steven Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger, and Kevin McCollum as the producers, the movie's release date was set to be sometime around December 2020 by 20th Century Studios.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, it was postponed due to the pandemic. The much-anticipated film is now slated to release on Dec. 10, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBpsLEp2SsqJmauaOx0aBksJ2jqXq0tcOeZKysn6fGbsDRmqClnaJiv6a4xJqqnmWUlsGmesetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
