He just would get a different look on his face, and he talked about it so nonchalantly, like going down to get a cup of coffee,” Cadle recalled of an in-person meeting.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Frank Rzucek (left), the father of Shan’ann Watts, and her brother, Frankie Rzucek, at Watts’ arraignment on Aug. 21, 2018. <span class=credit>Denver Post via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Watts and Cadle had at least one three-hour “contact” visit after initially corresponding, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 WDOC report</a> obtained by Inside Edition shows.</p><p>More recently, Watts is said to have grown close to Dylan Tallman, a fellow Dodge inmate who insists Watts is innocent, the outlet reported — adding that both men became religious behind bars and jointly self-published a prayer book titled “Revelation in the Reckoning” in 2021.</p><p>“My past is a blueprint and the devil the architect. While I watch his fallen ones build stone upon stone every day I see these walls as insurmountable, a barrier that blocks me from enjoying your love, your peace, and of your joy, oh Lord,” one prayer allegedly reads.</p><p>“You are my master builder. Help me walk around these walls, sound the trumpet and shout that they may come crashing down like the walls of Jericho.”</p><p>Religion is a crucial part of Watts’ “healing process,” the 2020 WDOC report stated, according to the outlet.</p><p>“In regards to his feelings towards the victims, he just kind of renewed his faith and talks to the victims through prayer,” it said.</p><p>Watts was arrested on Aug. 15, 2018 — two days after Shan’ann, Bella, and Cece were reported missing from the family’s Frederick, Colo., home.</p><p>Though he initially denied he was involved in the disappearance of his wife and daughters, Watts eventually confessed to strangling Shan’ann — who was 15 weeks pregnant — in the early hours of Aug. 13, 2018.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shan’ann Watts’ mother, Sandra Rzucek, at Watts’ sentencing hearing. <span class=credit>Denver Post via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Watts initially said Shan’ann killed their daughters in a rage after he asked for a separation, but eventually confessed to smothering the little girls with blankets after driving them and his wife’s body to the Anadarko Petroleum plant where he worked.</p><p>Shan’ann’s body was subsequently found in a shallow grave on the oil field; the remains of Bella and Cece were recovered from crude oil storage tanks.</p><p>Autopsies revealed both little girls had oil, water, and sludge in their stomachs.</p><p>Watts avoided the death penalty by pleading guilty to the murders of Shan’ann, Bella, and Cece, and the unlawful termination of their unborn son, Nico, on Nov. 6, 2018.</p><p>He is serving five life sentences at Dodge <a href=#>after being transferred from a Colorado facility</a> in December 2018 because of security concerns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fmam9fm66utcuyZKShnKGys3nCoamiq12srrXA0magrGWgp7a0u81mmq6rpKSxqq3NZp%2Baq12bsq6ty55kqZ2eYr2iuNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
