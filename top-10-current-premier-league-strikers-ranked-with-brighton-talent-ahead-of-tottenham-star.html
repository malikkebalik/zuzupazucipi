Players must have scored at least ten league goals and play in the central role.</p><p>As a result, some of the league's best scorers, such as Aston Villa and England's Ollie Watkins (who averages a goal every 231 minutes) have been omitted. Mohamed Salah (134 minutes per goal) and other high scorers that do not play as out-and-out strikers or centre-forwards are also not included in this ranking.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Julian Alvarez (Manchester City | 188 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/julian-alvarez-manchester-city-celebrates-853973673.jpg><p>Not many strikers would find it easy to keep up with a certain 6ft 3in Norwegian, but Julian Alvarez certainly does that.</p><p>Manchester City's second choice striker has also been a hit at the Etihad, stepping up to the plate when Pep Guardiola's first choice Erling Haaland is being rested or injured.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>It's easy to forget how many Premier League teams Alvarez would find himself being first pick in. There's a reason why he became the first player in football history to win the&nbsp;World Cup with Argentina&nbsp;and the&nbsp;treble with Man City&nbsp;in the same season.</p><p>Tirelessly running around off the ball, Alvarez is also versatile, being able to play in midfield and on the wings, making him a brilliant asset to Guardiola's side.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Ivan Toney (Brentford | 184 minutes per</h2><p>Since bursting on the scene with Brentford following their promotion to the Premier League in 2021, Ivan Toney has barged his way to being one of the league's best strikers after his disappointing time at Newcastle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/brentfords-english-striker-ivan-toney-808647427-1.jpg><p>Toney has netted 11 out of 12 penalties he's taken in the Premier League, with the one miss coming against his former club, Newcastle, in April.</p><p>But aside from being near-perfect from the spot, Toney has a number of other attributes that make him the second best striker in the league, including a <a aria-label="better aerial dual record (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">better aerial dual record</a> than Kane for most of last term. It's easy to understand why <a href=#>the Bees don't want to let sell him</a>.</p><p>Brentford boss Thomas Frank best described how effective a goalscorer he is in 2021. "He has got all the abilities," he said. "His link-up play, his finishing, timing in the box and his awareness."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Heung-min Son (Tottenham | 180 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/son-heung-min-tottenham-hotspur-854449210.jpg><p>Heung-min Son spent a number of years on the wing, but Kane's departure in the summer left a gaping hole in Tottenham's front three.</p><p>Fans immediately thought of Richarlison, the Brazilian that joined from Everton in 2022. Soon, though, Ange Postecoglou made the bold but genius move of swapping the pair over and putting Son up front.</p><p>After winning the Golden Boot alongside Mohamed Salah in 2022, Son had a dip in form last term. Now though, he looks to be back at his best, already <a href=#>the second highest scorer in the league</a> so far this season.</p><p>That's made all the more impressive given he's doing that in a brand new role.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Callum Wilson (Newcastle United | 179 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/callum-wilson-newcastle-united-scores-853997091.jpg><p>Callum Wilson has been bagging goals in the Premier League for longer than most on this list, first scoring them for Bournemouth before his £20m move to Newcastle in 2020.</p><p>The former Coventry star loves scoring a great goal out of nothing, a skill that any club in the league would love to have in their team.</p><p>There's a reason he was the fifth highest scorer in the Premier League in 2022/23 (18 goals).</p><p>When you consider he's been struggling to get into Eddie Howe's team over Alexander Isak and he regularly struggles with a hamstring injury, Wilson could arguably be higher on this list without those issues.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Darwin Nunez (Liverpool | 177 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/darwin-nunez-liverpool-scores-third-855125407.jpg><p>Darwin Nunez's arrival at Anfield from Benfica was one of the most highly anticipated moves last summer. After becoming a star in Portugal and netting a whopping 34 goals in all competitions in the 2021/22 season, there we high expectations placed on the Uruguayan.</p><p>If we'd been writing this based off last campaign's stats, we wouldn't have included him. However, this season, we're all aboard the Nunez hype train that Liverpool fans have been trying to get us all to hop on - and his minutes per game speak for themselves.</p><p>That's not to say his goal tally of 15 goals last term wasn't decent for a striker starting out in the Premier League and playing in a below-par Liverpool side.</p><p>However, this season has seen him mostly <a href=#>swerve away from wasting golden goal scoring opportunities</a> in Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool 2.0. It's been a joy to watch him shake off the heavy social media criticism he got last term.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Gabriel Jesus (Arsenal | 168 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/09/gabriel-jesus-scoring-third-goal-842239642.jpg><p>Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus was brought in from Manchester City as Mikel Arteta looked to find a new, star no.9 - and the Brazilian certainly had the instant impact Arteta would've hoped for.</p><p>Jesus not only scored plenty of goals but also provided assists to help the Gunners go top of the league and gave his side a new threat after them being so reliant on their wingers. He has unfortunately spent a lot of <a href=#>time out injured</a>, though.</p><p>His injury at the World Cup and subsequent absence from Arsenal's match day squads spoke volumes about his impact, with the Gunners going on to miss out on the title in the end.</p><p>It'd be lazy to say just because Jesus doesn't boast the highest goal tallies that he's not a good striker. He makes Arsenal a better side when he plays and his work, both on and off the ball, is invaluable.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Taiwo Awoniyi (Nottingham Forest | 149 mins per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/taiwo-awoniyi-nottingham-forest-scores-840331321.jpg><p>Since joining Nottingham Forest for their return to the Premier League last season, Awoniyi has helped the Tricky Trees show why they belong in the top flight.</p><p>His goals in each of Forest's final four league games at the end of the campaign, including the winner in the 1-0 win over Arsenal, shows how key the 26-year-old is to Steve Cooper's side.</p><p>The Nigerian international has carried that form in to this season, too, scoring in each of the opening three games before providing two assists in the next two.</p><p>Keep your eyes on this guy, Premier League fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Evan Ferguson (Brighton and Hove Albion | 141 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/09/evan-ferguson-brighton-hove-albion-841989061.jpg><p>Taking third place is Brighton's teenage prodigy Evan Ferguson.</p><p>Roberto De Zerbi and co brought in Joao Pedro from Watford over the summer and he has been particularly clinical in the Europa League, so certainly deserves an honourable mention.</p><p>But there's no doubt Ferguson deserves recognition. There's a reason why he's been <a href=#>compared to former Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney</a>.</p><p>His strength and ability to read the game allows you to forget that he only made his debut for the Albion last year, and you can notice when he's absent. It's scary to think how good he will become as he gains more and more experience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Alexander Isak (Newcastle | 126 mins per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/alexander-isak-newcastle-united-scores-850985880.jpg><p>As Callum Wilson makes it into a our top ten, it's no surprise to see his fellow Newcastle striker also make the cut. Isak brings a different style to Eddie Howe's team than his English counterpart, though.</p><p>After signing for a club record fee of £63m, there was plenty of pressure on Isak's shoulders as Newcastle were building a new identity under their news owners.</p><p>Howe had spotted Isak while he was playing for Sweden's youth sides, immediately warming to his athleticism and pace. He's certainly brought the quality to the Premier League now and complimented goal-poacher Wilson.</p><p>Isak has also <a href=#>struggled with injury issues</a>. However, when Howe has both him and Wilson at his disposal, Newcastle are a tough outfit to defend against.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Erling Haaland (Manchester City | 78 minutes per goal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/erling-haaland-manchester-city-scores-855893307.jpg><p>It'll be no surprise to anyone that Manchester City's superstar striker Erling Haaland takes the top spot in the rankings - and there's good reason for that.</p><p>The 23-year-old broke the record for most goals in a single Premier League season in his debut campaign for City, scoring 36 goals in 35 appearances, beating Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (who both set the record of 34 in 42-game campaigns).</p><p>He has also scored the most goals in one season in all competitions by a Premier League player (52), comfortably surpassing Liverpool's Salah in 2017/18 and&nbsp;Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2002/03 (both scored 44). It's no wonder players are <a href=#>desperate to swap shirts</a> with him.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>His intelligent movement that helps him free up space for his teammates combined with his deadly finishing, physical strength and height makes him so tough to nullify.
