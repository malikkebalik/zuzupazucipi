It’s OK, but it’s not really for us.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">The girls and their mom landed a $60k deal on ‘Shark Tank.’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>During Shark Tank Season 8, Episode 4, Madison and Mallory pitched Angels and Tomboys alongside their mom, Viara Iyadunni. They sought $55,000 in exchange for 20 percent of their company. They even brought along a music video to hype up their fragrances to the Sharks.

Daymond John and Mark Cuban offered $60,000 for a third of the company, and Iyadunni and her daughters happily accepted the deal.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-jXcwIi jyCgFD"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Angels and Tomboys opened a brick-and-mortar store in 2018.</h2><p>After enlisting the Atlanta-based firm Professional Products Unlimited to produce the body care products, Madison and Mallory and their mom opened a physical store in Memphis, Tenn., in 2018, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Commercial Appeal</u></a>.
