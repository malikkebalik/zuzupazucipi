They want to put this right.</p><p>“We know the standards here and we have to match the standards every day. We’ve had two big setbacks but we will fight back. This dressing room is strong, this staff is strong and this manager is strong to put this right.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Erik ten Hag's future at Manchester United: What we're hearing</p></a><p>Put to him that pundits had suggested United were lacking a recognisable style of play, Ten Hag said: “I don’t want to say that. I think that is too strong.</p><p>“The intention is clear but it is definitely the case that the execution isn’t there, but I think that in the moment we are in — with so many changes in every game — we can’t line up the same two, three games after each other and we have to swap.</p><p>“Now we miss players often in the back four and every time we have to adjust and that doesn’t help in your routines. Also, the midfield, we have to adjust, missing <a class=ath_autolink data-id=wQ6Q8xViV8kqizDc href=#>Casemiro</a>, who’s an important player.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/11/02164441/GettyImages-1763491720-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Diogo Dalot looks dejected after defeat to Newcastle (Getty Images)</span><p>“But we have to win and I don’t want to find excuses if we’re not winning. Now we have to be more pragmatic but still we have to win. These are the demands and I don’t walk away from that.”</p><p>Pressed further on his <a href=#>recent comments that his Manchester United side would “never” play like Ajax</a>, Ten Hag said: “I came here with my philosophy, based on possession, but also (to) combine it with the DNA of Manchester United and the characteristics of the players.</p><p>“We played very good football last season. This season the philosophy is not different. We go more direct, but the explanation for direct is I want to go for long balls? No, I don’t. If the opponent is going in high press, it is a good option to go direct. We want to press from different blocks and then go direct because we have the players like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xgQlXcNj79jwXiD4 href=#>Marcus Rashford</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=rXernJIkIW9dTOdt href=#>Scott McTominay</a> and then the full-backs joining in and I explain it very clear.”</p><p>Off the field, <a href=#>Sir Jim Ratcliffe is prepared to commit $300million (£245m)</a> of his personal wealth for infrastructure upgrades at Manchester United if he completes a purchase of a minority stake in the club, but asked about potential money for new players, Ten Hag said: “I have a good squad and I am convinced the players in this dressing room, they can do a lot better, but that is up to me.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“I have the responsibility to let them play better and I will put every effort in. I am not thinking about (transfers).&nbsp;I am convinced the players will be hard to beat and they know how to do it.”</p><p>Casemiro is will be out for “several weeks” with a hamstring injury and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KTCFlS2lUObXRtJa href=#>Victor Lindelof</a> is a doubt, but <a class=ath_autolink data-id=fqIirRcGC4muo1f5 href=#>Raphael Varane</a> is set to return at Craven Cottage.</p><p>“Varane is ready to play so he will travel with the squad,” Ten Hag added. “Just Victor Lindelof, some illness; we have to see if he is ready for tomorrow.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Why are Manchester United playing so poorly?</p></a><p>(Photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGlpbW1iZ3xzfJFsZmppX2WAcLnAp5qhnaOpsrN51KegrZ2UYrKztcpmq56mXZ2uqHnLmqueq6Rk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
