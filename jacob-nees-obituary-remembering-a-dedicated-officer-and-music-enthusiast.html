This weekend, the law enforcement community lost a promising young officer, a dedicated public servant, and a passionate music enthusiast. Deputy Nees, who recently joined the Sheriff’s Office, tragically lost his life in an off-duty vehicle accident.</p><p>Deputy Nees began his journey with us just two months ago, after successfully graduating from our esteemed Academy. A 2018 alumnus of Mount Union, he earned a degree in Criminal Justice, reflecting his strong commitment to upholding the law and maintaining the safety of our community. Before donning our uniform, he served as a parole officer, showcasing his unwavering dedication to rehabilitation and second chances.</p><p>Beyond his professional life, Deputy Nees was known for his vibrant personality and his love for music. He pursued his passion for drumming, becoming an integral part of several local bands. His rhythmic beats resonated through the local music scene, a testament to his dedication and creative spirit.</p><p>Deputy Nees leaves behind a legacy of hard work, dedication, and a willingness to go above and beyond for the betterment of our society. His infectious enthusiasm for his work and his commitment to justice will continue to inspire us all. As we mourn the loss of a dear colleague, friend, and family member, we are reminded of the profound impact he had on all those fortunate enough to cross paths with him.</p><p>During this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences go out to Deputy Nees’ family, friends, and loved ones. We stand together as a tight-knit law enforcement community, united in our grief and determined to honor his memory by continuing the important work he started. Deputy Jacob Nees may be gone, but his spirit will forever live on in the hearts and minds of all who had the privilege of knowing him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtp5Kewbat0bJlnKedZLeir86bZKedlah6sK7Irayaqqliv6a5xKaZnqqZo7RurYydnJ2hk5bBprCMqJ2foZOav26tzZ1kpq2jnrBusc2tn66rmZbAtXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
