The baby eats it all day long and she’s fine too,” he said.</p><p>Even though they’re barred from distributing it to customers, Mason said the couple may hold private tasting parties “at our apartment or in the park in the spring with wine.”</p><p>Mason, who has been propositioned by several creepy customers eager to sample her breast milk, offered one caveat.</p><p>“We may need security to stop the weird fetish people from coming in.”</p><p>The Health Department nixed the cheese-party idea, too.</p><p>“He can’t do that either,” the spokeswoman said.</p><p><a href=#>jeremy.olshan@nypost.com</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnF7j2xmamhfncKurc1mmqGdlaiybrnAZpuopqRitaLCxGaYZpufrHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
