He has, however, become better at taking his chances with women since then. Most recently, <a class=underline-link href=#>he outright told Tiffany Haddish that they should pair up to make an OnlyFans video</a>.</p><p>The conversation went down in an Instagram Live earlier this week, during which Yak attempted to quell rumors that he needs help after <a class=underline-link href=#>his recent Drink Champs interview sparked concerns</a>. When the comedian joined the stream, Kodak switched gears and suggested they get together and record adult content.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Uh, nope, we not doing that,” she replied. “First of all, I’m too old for that shit. Second of all, you know I got box office movies. I don’t need to go on an OnlyFans, okay?”</p><p>He then pivoted and asked for a movie cameo, but Haddish instead got him to agree to make a song together. She has plans to be in his home state of Florida next month for a court date, so they decided to hop inside the studio together then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miiqJyRoHqjuMCcomaZpZm2tbXOp2SdoaOjsrp50qGYpJ1dnsFuwc9msZ6mlJbGog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
