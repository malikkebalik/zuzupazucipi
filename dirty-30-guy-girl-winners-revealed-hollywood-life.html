Hey, it&nbsp;was the dirtiest season of all time, so it’s no surprise that Teej kept things interesting until the very last minute! For the guys, it came down to&nbsp;<strong>Jordan, CT</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Derrick K</strong>, and for the girls, it was between&nbsp;<strong>Cara Maria, Tori</strong> and<strong> Camila.&nbsp;</strong>Since the intense final challenge was broken down into various, timed sections with wild twists, it was impossible for the challengers to know who finished in the shortest amount of time, until TJ made the announcement at the reunion, which aired Nov. 14 and Nov. 21.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Well, you want to know who it was, right?! First, the finalists (minus Camila, who didn’t show up — TJ stood in her place) pulled the double cross to find out who landed in third place, and the “losers” were&nbsp;<strong>Tori</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>CT</strong>, who won $15,000 each. We had to wait until part two of the reunion to get the rest of the results, and by the end of the Nov. 21 episode, we finally had the results. And the winners of Dirty 30 are…<strong>Jordan</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Camila!</strong> They’ll take home a whopping $450,000 each.&nbsp; In second place…<strong>Cara Maria</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Derrick</strong>, who will each walk away with $35,000. &nbsp;Yeah, that’s a pretty HUGE difference in dollar amounts between second and first place, but again, this season was all about the game being&nbsp;dirtier than ever. Regardless of the money, the finalists have a lot to be proud of, as they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beat some of the best</a> in the game to get to the end.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>During part one of the reunion, we also learned that Tori and&nbsp;<strong>Derrick H</strong> ended their relationship…after she hooked up with Jordan. Based on social media stalking, it looks like Tori and Jordan are still with each other, too! Oh, and&nbsp;<strong>Cory</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Kailah</strong> are (somewhat) cool these days after a&nbsp;lot of drama on&nbsp;The Challenge: Invasion. Part two of the reunion featured a massive showdown between Cara and Kailah, and it’s clear they’ll never be friends. Tony and Cara also (sort of) squashed their beef, and Tony and his baby mama,&nbsp;<strong>Alyssa</strong>, confirmed they’re still together and working on their relationship after he kissed Camila on the show. Speaking of Camila, she chose not to attend the reunion after throwing racial slurs at&nbsp;<strong>Leroy</strong> on the show, and even her closest ally, Cara, revealed she hadn’t heard from her.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>DRUMROLL PLEASE… Don't miss <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#TheChallengeXXX</a> Reunion Finale TONIGHT at 10/9c! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/AMVO8vbwBB</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/DrG5av5jOM</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>— challengemtv (@ChallengeMTV) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 14, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, were you surprised by who won this season of&nbsp;The Challenge?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH5ye5FqZrCgn2LEsLqMrZ%2BeZZOdrq24xKeenmWUnr%2B1xYxsZ2awqK16uLXNp5yrq12nsqStz2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
