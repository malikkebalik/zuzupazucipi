He shared a series of snaps alongside the announcement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Jared Leto Playing Gay Artist&nbsp;Andy Warhol</h2><p>Leto confirmed that he would be playing the famed artist, producer, and director Warhol in the near future. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After sharing his gratitude and excitement over his new role, he took the time out to wish the legend a happy belated birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>"We miss you and your genius," he penned as he closed the captions.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Warhol was the artist who brought what is now known as pop art into popular culture for those unaware. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Some of his most sought-after works of art include&nbsp;the classic 'Campbell's Soup Cans'&nbsp;and the 'Marilyn Diptych,' both of which he created in 1962.</p><p>While the legendary artist's sexuality has often been suppressed or debated, The Andy Warhol Museum's official website announces loud and proud that he was, in fact, a gay man.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Warhol's boyfriends&nbsp;included Edward Wallowitch, John Giorno, and Jed Johnson, who were also his colleagues and collaborators, helping to shape and define his career as an artist. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Jared Leto on Opportunities for Gay People in Showbiz</h2><p>While Leto is understandably excited and grateful to have been able to play such an iconic genius, he has also been vocal about the marginalization of gay characters in Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>For his piece on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GQ </a>Style's&nbsp;cover story back in 2016, he explained that gay actors simply did not have the same amount of opportunities when contrasted against their straight counterparts. He said,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I definitely don’t think a gay leading man would have the same opportunities as a straight leading man. I don’t think that. Not for a single second.</p><h2>Jared Leto Argues Against Marginalization</h2><p>Fully aware of the fact that some people might find his statement offensive, he stressed that the marginalization of the gay community needed to be addressed.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He also spoke on behalf of other "minorities," (via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NDTV</a>) while professing his distaste for the word when he said that the situation was not any better for other communities. He said,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>What a word,&nbsp;minority. Have we taken that word off the list yet? ‘Cause it should be. Anyway, no, I think that this is still a very conservative business.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Jared Leto: "A&nbsp;Sense of Identity Is Critical to Empowering People"</h2><p>The actor who bagged an Academy Award for the Best Supporting Actor for playing a transgender woman in Dallas Buyers Club went on to share his take on masculinity and identity.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He shared how people worldwide were exploring different ideas of identity—not limited to masculinity and femininity. Leto was all for this movement.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Because a lot of people probably are marginalized still, and finding a sense of identity is critical to empowering people," he explained.&nbsp;</p><p>As for himself, Leto admitted to never having a specific idea of masculinity. Instead, he believed that it was okay to be one's own self and whatever that entailed.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRp7Klecueq6hll5bGb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
