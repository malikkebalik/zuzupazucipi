However, Chatham had always held a special place in Mary’s heart, playing a significant role in her life for many years. Mary’s connection to Chatham and the surrounding New England area runs deep.

Her commitment to the area solidified in 2003 when she acquired her own home in Chatham.</p><p>Before her relocation to Chatham, during her time in Chicago, Mary immersed herself in the real estate industry. For two years, she excelled as a real estate professional in Oak Park, IL. Prior to venturing into real estate, she dedicated a decade to computer sales and recruiting, showcasing her diverse skill set and adaptability.</p><p>Over the past 15 years, Mary took on the challenge of constructing and renovating three homes, demonstrating her keen eye for property development. She also efficiently managed three rental properties, further highlighting her competence in the real estate realm. Mary’s educational background included a degree in marketing from the University of Massachusetts, providing her with a solid foundation for her real estate endeavors. Her character was marked by remarkable qualities: boundless energy, ambition, conscientiousness, and an unwavering dedication to hard work.<br>Town of Chatham, MA, shared a facebook post, sharing sorrow&nbsp; for Mary Cavanaugh.
