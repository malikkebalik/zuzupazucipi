Made with just a few simple ingredients, including ripe bananas, this homemade dessert is naturally sweet, dairy-free, and vegan-friendly. In this guide, we’ll show you how to make banana ice cream at home using basic ingredients and easy-to-follow steps.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><ul><li>Ripe bananas (preferably frozen)</li><li>Optional add-ins: vanilla extract, cocoa powder, peanut butter, nuts, chocolate chips, fruit, etc.</li></ul><li>Prepare the Bananas Start by peeling the ripe bananas and slicing them into coins. If you prefer a creamier texture, you can freeze the banana slices beforehand. Simply place the banana slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li><li>Blend the Banana Slices Once the banana slices are frozen (if using), transfer them to a blender or food processor. Blend the banana slices on high speed until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the blender or food processor as needed. You may need to add a splash of liquid, such as plant-based milk or water, to help the blending process.</li><li>Add Optional Ingredients If desired, you can customize your banana ice cream by adding optional ingredients to the blender along with the banana slices. Popular add-ins include vanilla extract for flavor, cocoa powder for chocolatey goodness, peanut butter for nutty richness, nuts or chocolate chips for texture, or additional fruit for extra sweetness.</li><li>Blend Until Smooth Continue blending the banana mixture until all the ingredients are well combined and the ice cream reaches your desired consistency. If the mixture is too thick, you can add more liquid to thin it out. If it’s too thin, you can add more frozen banana slices to thicken it.</li><li>Serve Immediately or Freeze for Later Once the banana ice cream reaches the desired consistency, it’s ready to be served immediately as soft-serve ice cream. Scoop the ice cream into bowls or cones and enjoy it as is, or you can transfer it to a container and freeze it for later. If freezing for later, allow the ice cream to firm up in the freezer for at least 1-2 hours before serving.</li><li>Garnish and Enjoy Before serving, you can garnish your banana ice cream with additional toppings or add-ins for extra flavor and texture. Popular garnishes include fresh fruit, nuts, chocolate sauce, shredded coconut, or a sprinkle of cinnamon. Get creative and have fun experimenting with different toppings to create your perfect banana ice cream masterpiece.</li><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=#>How To Grill Tilapia</a></p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57x6iuZqyfYrqit8RmmZqmkaOubrXCnmScqpWWum6t02afqKWVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
