Onfroy&nbsp;was born on <strong>January 26, 2019</strong>.</p><h2>XXXTentacion's Relationship With Jenesis Sanchez</h2><p>Gekyume Onfroy's parents, XXXTentacion and Jenesis Sanchez, first got into a relationship with each other in <strong>January 2018</strong> and were going strong till the death of the rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/9/304172367_1611579022572367_5143097575101701589_n%20(1)-1667979147789.jpg><p>A familiar friend of theirs first introduced them to each other at a party. They hit it off soon enough, and a year later, they were blessed with a baby in Onfroy.</p><p>Long after X's death, she still loves him, and she showed it to the world with a heartfelt letter she wrote for her late boyfriend on their son's second birthday. The letter was about their son and all the fantastic moments she shared with him.</p><h2>Gekyme Onfroy's Father's Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>Without a doubt, Onfroy's father was a huge deal. XXXTentacion was one of the fastest-growing rappers in the hip-hop scene. It seems like all the controversies couldn't stop him, as his estimated net worth at the time of his death was<strong> $5 million (</strong>the same as Russian Actor <a href=# rel=nofollow>Aleksandr Galibin</a>).</p><p>Most of his money came from his music career itself. <i>The New York Times</i>, shortly after his death, reported that he had signed a deal worth <strong>$10 million</strong> for his third album.</p><h2>A Brief On Gekyme Onfroy's Father XXXTentacion</h2><p>XXXTentacion, or X, is an American rapper and songwriter regarded as a controversial figure in the hip-hop world. He has a huge fanbase, but at the same time, a lot of people don't like him too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/9/Xxxtentacion_(cropped)%20(1)-1667979265974.jpg><p>The Florida rapper was born in Plantation on <strong>January 23, 1998</strong>. He is known for songs like <i>Moonlight</i> and <i>SAD!</i>, with both pieces getting over a billion views on YouTube. He was tragically shot dead at the age of twenty on <strong>June 18, 2018</strong>.</p><h2>Gekyume Onfroy Never Got To Meet His Father:</h2><p>Onfroy's father has a huge fanbase. His popularity has translated to his son as well. Unfortunately for him, he never got to see his father in the flesh, as X had died long before the birth of Onfroy.&nbsp;</p><p>The<i> SAD!</i> rapper's death is no secret. His death was the news of the whole week. The information reported that he was shot dead. The rapper was only twenty years old at the time, and seven months into his death, fans believe he was born again in the form of his son.</p><p>XXXTentacion's death again led to the conversation on hip-hop guns and gang culture in America. The subject has been one of the hottest debates in the country for a while. This isn't the first time that a bullet killed some American rapper. It's tragically one of the main reasons many rappers die at a young age, and Tentacion's death was no different.</p><h2>Conspiracies Surrounding His Father's Death</h2><p>The <i>Look at Me!</i> Rapper XXXTentacion's death shocked the whole fanbase. It's safe to say they didn't handle the end of their beloved rapper well. His death led to the rise of numerous conspiracies, and some fans believe that some of these theories are true.</p><p>One of these bizarre theories started due to the music video of the rapper's song <i>SAD!</i>. There is a scene where XXXTentacion is seen attending his funeral. Many speculated he already knew he would get killed and, thus, made a video to tell the fans.&nbsp;</p><p>They believed a higher power was involved and conspired to take his life. It also didn't help that Tentacion talked about his potential death in one of his Instagram lives, where he said:</p><p>If worse thing comes to worst, and I f****** die or some s*** and I’m not able to see out my dreams, I at least want to know that the kids perceived my message and were able to make something of themselves and able to take my message and use it and turn it into something positive and to at least have a good life.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Another popular theory suggests that he is still alive and that the <i>Revenge</i> rapper's death was completely staged. It was believed he did so to promote his works. The ideas only keep getting weirder and weirder. There is also one involving <a href=# rel=nofollow>Melyssa Ford's</a> ex-boyfriend, rapper Drake too.</p><h2>Onfroy's Father Was A Domestic Violence Perpetrator</h2><p>XXXTentacion died at a young age. It also didn't help that he was constantly on the radar of the law and the media because of some of his past actions. A case was filed against him that showed that he had physically assaulted his ex-girlfriend, <strong>Geneve Ayala</strong>.</p><p>Per the news article published by the <i>BBC</i> in <strong>2019</strong>, he was found confessing to physically assaulting a pregnant woman through a leaked recording. The recording also saw him revealing other incidents, like stabbing people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/9/XXXTentacion-jailed-on-felony-charges%20(1)-1667979736543.jpg><p>The recording had him saying:</p><p>I put my source of happiness in another person, which was a mistake initially, right? But she fell through on every occasion until now. Until I started f****** her up bruh. I started f****** her up because she made one mistake. And from there, the whole cycle went down. Now she’s scared. That girl is scared for her life. Which I understand.</p><h2>Onfroy Got His Name From His Father</h2><p>How did Gekyume Onfroy get his name? Well, it turns out the name came from because of his father. The RIP Roach singer, XXXTentacion, died seven months before he could see his baby.</p><p>The term <strong>Gekyume</strong> means "higher state of mind." The reason why the word is unique is that the term was created by X himself. He also has a <a href=# rel=nofollow>song</a> by the same name.</p><h2>A Custody Battle Between Gekyme Onfroy's Mother & His Grandma:</h2><p>Poor Onfroy, at such a young age, had to go through a lot. He was already the talk of the media even before being born, as his mother revealed her pregnancy after Tentacion's death. And it only got worse when his mom and Grandma decided to take matters to court to determine who gets to keep him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/9/299320962_1072426793440288_2476312159495664945_n%20(1)-1667979477460.jpg><p><strong>Jenesis Sanchez</strong> and <strong>Cleopatra Bernard</strong> went to court to settle the matters on who gets to keep the child. As per the reports published by <i>Blast</i>, shortly after the birth of Onfroy, mother Jenesis went to the court to obtain a DNA sample test to determine he was the baby's father entirely. Mother Cleopater objected, but she was overruled.&nbsp;</p><p>A test result later proved that he was indeed the son of XXXTentacion. Luckily, the battle between his mother and grandmother ended before things got sour. They found common ground and reached an agreement. The details of the settlement remain undisclosed.</p><h2>Where Is Gekyume Onfroy Now? Is He Active On Social Media?</h2><p>Onfroy is still young to be using social media. But that doesn't mean you can't learn more about XXXTentacion's son through the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>His mom, Jenesis Sanchez, often posts about him on Instagram. Her Insta handle is <a href=# rel=nofollow>@jenesisgiselle</a>. Not just his mom but his grandma Cleopatra Bernard also posts about her grandson now and then. Her Insta handle is <a href=# rel=nofollow>@cleo_ohsojazzy</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more exciting Celebrity Bios.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqCcpLGlorJuu82fqaix</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
