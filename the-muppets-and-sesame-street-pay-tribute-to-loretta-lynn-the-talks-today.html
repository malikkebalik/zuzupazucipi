Lynn, who was known for her many hits including “One’s on the Way,” “Fist City,” and “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” died in her sleep at her home on Tuesday. She was 90 years old.</p><p>Though best known for her music, Lynn was also the subject of the 1980 biopic Coal Miner’s Daughter starring Sissy Spacek (Carrie) as the legendary singer. Spacek won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in the film, which was also nominated for Best Picture among other awards.</p><p>Lynn would also make the occasional television appearance which includes a stint in The Muppet Show in 1978. The episode is set at a railroad station and is sometimes interrupted by passing trains, but guest star Lynn keeps things cheery by telling Kermit the Frog that “country singers can sing anywhere.” Lynn would perform multiple songs throughout the episode.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>MOVIEWEB VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p>After Lynn’s death, the official account for The Muppets on Twitter posted a message of tribute.</p><p>“Working with our friend Loretta Lynn was unforgettable,” the message reads. “Not only was she a country music legend, but when she joined us on The Muppet Show, she proved she was game for almost anything – even putting on an entire show at a train station! Thanks for the music and memories, Loretta.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: Sacheen Littlefeather, Activist Who Declined Marlon Brando’s Godfather Oscar, Dies at 75</span></p><h2 id=loretta-lynn-and-the-count-had-quality-counting-time-on-sesame-street>Loretta Lynn and The Count Had Quality Counting Time on Sesame Street</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Loretta-Lynn.jpg><p>Appearing with Kermit and pals on The Muppet Show was not Lynn’s only time spend with Muppets. In 1981, she joined The Count to perform the song “Count on Me” on an episode of Sesame Street. She would separately record a rendition of the song for the tie-in album Sesame Country. Lynn returned to Sesame Street in 1984 to perform “Songs Are for Singing” with a group of children.</p><p>Given her memorable appearances on Sesame Street, the show’s Twitter account posted a video clip of the late singer and The Count along with the message, “Thank you for always being that friend we could count on, Loretta Lynn.”</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Lynn once appeared on a 1989 episode of The Tonight Show which also featured Jhim Henson and Kermit the Frog. She referenced the time she appeared on The Muppet Show and could be seen interacting with Henson and Kermit at the end of the show.</p><p>Our condolences go out to Lynn’s family and friends at this painful time. May the music legend rest in peace as her legacy lives on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiroZ1dosKxvMStqmaZnpl6tLHSmqSeZaOpv6ax02anmrFdqb%2BqrtStnGasn2K5sL7ErauaZZyuu697</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
