While “bad” people should be “prepared to pay the piper”, she said there shouldn’t be so much tension around sharing personal takes.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Trump should take election case to TV’s ‘Judge Judy’, suggests Internet after SCOTUS refuses to hear lawsuit</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Judge Judy says she will 'fight to the death' against Bernie Sanders: 'America doesn’t need a revolution'</a></p><p>“(To) have a fear of speaking your opinion, for fear of being put on somebody’s list and canceled? It’s a frightening place for America to be,” she said speaking about the cancel culture. Talking about the biggest flaw in the US justice system, she said it was the “length of time that it takes for people to get a conclusion”. She believes it takes “too long” to reach a verdict, and blamed it on “a result of lazy judges or lawyers who have a financial interest in keeping a case going”.</p><p>She also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">opened up</a> about Derek Chauvin's verdict, calling it swift — particularly because the world was watching. “That’s what happens when you have a movie,” she said. “It wasn’t an issue as to what happened. And the judge, I think he was pretty straight-up. He didn’t duck and cover. The media wasn’t going to allow any delay, and rightfully so. The country wanted a resolution. It’s a different age now. If it’s a homicide, a robbery, a burglary… you often have it on video.”</p><h2 class=split>Judge Judy's net worth</h2><p>Nearly two decades ago, Judge Judy negotiated her massive salary, reportedly $47M a season, by making clear to CBS that while they needed her and her show, she did not need them. “I told the company that I worked for this: ‘I want to be more of a partner. Don’t treat me as a paid employee. I could make this show without you, I created a deal where I could do that but you can’t make it without me. I can take Judy Sheindlin anywhere else. And good luck with you if you can find somebody else. Otherwise, let’s share the gift that this program has brought to both of us,’” she recalled.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she has a net worth of $440M. Her income in 2005 was $15M per year. She renegotiated that contract in 2010 which resulted in her nearly $50M annual income. She works for around 52 days a year, which translates to around $900,000 per workday. Between June 2017 and June 2018, she made $147M. The extra $100M came from a one-time windfall after selling her old episodes back to CBS for syndication. CBS had previously not believed the old episodes were valuable and never negotiated an ownership stake.</p><h2 class=split>Judge Judy's real estate</h2><p>Judy owns an impressive set of real estate that is worth at least $100M. Her primary residence, for tax purposes, is a $13M ocean-view home in Naples, Florida. She also owns another house in Naples that is worth $11M. Judy and her husband Judge Jerry Sheindlin also own a nine-bedroom mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut that they bought for $13.2M in 2007. Today this 12.5-acre property is likely worth more than $20M. They own a five-bedroom condo in Beverly Hills that set them back $10.7M in 2013. They own an $8.5M New York City pied-a-terre. In August 2018, Judy and Jerry spent $9M to acquire a Newport, Rhode Island, mansion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooqWZtrW0jKyfnqGembmquoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMo6ydn5Vit7aw2GaamqaTmrlur9Slq66qlWKBeHnMoqOloZ%2BjerSty5qpsmWUmr%2Bmt4ycn5qtpp67</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
