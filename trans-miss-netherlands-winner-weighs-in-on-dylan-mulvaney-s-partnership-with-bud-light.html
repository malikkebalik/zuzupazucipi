I think it’s horrible,” the 22-year-old beauty pageant winner, Rikkie Valerie Kollé, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a>.</p><p>“They see us as monsters,” added Kollé, who began her transition from male to female at 16 years old.</p><p>“My daily DMs [direct messages] are full of people wishing me dead. Wishing me dead and telling me to suicide.”</p><p>Kollé added that she was “sad” by what ensued after Mulvaney — who transitioned from male to female in March 2021 — shared a series of Instagram posts on April 1 featuring herself taking a bubble bath with a Bud Light in hand, and another sharing the custom can the beer brand sent her with her face on it to celebrate “365 Days of Girlhood.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Rikkie Valerie Kollé, 22, said that the backlash from Dylan Mulvaney’s disastrous partnership with Bud Light has been “horrible,” and that people see her and Mulvaney “as monsters.” <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>However, Kollé’s not letting the hate get to her, as she prepares for another potential historic win at the Miss Universe pageant on Jan. 14, 2024.</p><p>“The only thing I want to say to the haters is ‘thank you,’ because you’re giving me a bigger platform than I can ever imagine,” she told Newsweek.</p><p>Mulvaney, meanwhile, <a href=#>sought a change of scenery in Peru “to feel safe” again</a> as she approaches the fourth month of ongoing blowback from her disastrous marketing campaign with the Bud Light — which has knocked the beer out of its No. 1 popularity spot and <a href=#>swiped $27 billion from its market cap.</a></p><p>The 26-year-old said she booked the trip to South Africa in a desperate bid to “feel something.”</p><p>“It’s a little sad that I had to leave my country to feel safe but that will get better eventually,” she added.</p><p>The type of culture war that ensued from the beleaguered beer’s scandal has made for a charged atmosphere when it comes to inclusive advertising, with many believing that brands that “go woke, go broke.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Kollé became the first transgender woman to win Miss Netherlands on Sunday — setting up a historic shot at becoming Miss Universe. <span class=credit>Instagram / @missnederland</span></figure><p>Just this week, the world’s largest cosmetics brand, <a href=#>Maybelline, came under fire for tapping mustachioed, bearded, and bald influencer Ryan Vita</a> to star in an Amazon Prime Day advert.</p><p>In the ad, Vita sports a full face of makeup and a beaded barette in his beard while applying bright pink shades of Maybelline’s “Super Stay” liquid lipstick.</p><p>Earlier this month, Nadya Okamoto, the CEO of “woke” tampon company August was dragged on social media after she <a href=#>called her customers “menstruators” instead of women</a> as she claimed her brand is “gender inclusive” during an interview with CBS Mornings.</p><p>Pro-LGBTQ+ moves companies made in honor of Pride Month in June also outraged conservatives.</p><p>At cheap-retailer Target, “tuck-friendly” women’s swimsuits and Pride-themed clothing for children and infants particularly irked consumers, <a href=#>leading to a $15 billion loss in market value</a> that caused the chain to pull some of its Pride merchandise or move displays further back in stores.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Mulvaney, 26, touched down in Peru earlier this week to “feel safe” again as she approaches the fourth month of ongoing criticism over her partnership with Bud Light. <span class=credit>Scott Kirkland/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>However, the <a href=#>LGBTQ community was outraged</a> when Target dialed back its Pride Month efforts.</p><p>Over at Adidas, a $70 “Pride Swimsuit” was listed under the “women’s” section of its website though it was <a href=#>being shown off by an apparently male model</a> who also was also displaying a noticeable bulge in the crotch area.</p><p>An accompanying video on Adidas’ site shows the model sashaying in the one-piece, with the camera at one point zooming to reveal a patch of chest hair rising above the neckline.</p><p>The casting triggered a flurry of criticism on social media. “I have breasts, hips, and no need for an extra pouch of fabric around my labia. I guess that means this bathing suit isn’t for me.. or most women,” one user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamxfqb%2BiutJmpKKro2K7psDHnqmlmZ6ZwG7DyKelnqpdrLKqs8esZKKmXaS7brDYpZinZZ2qubetzZ6wrGWglr%2B1usSrqqGhoGLEqsDHZpmunF2htqi002g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
