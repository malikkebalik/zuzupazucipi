Holding a BA in English from Thomas Edison State University, she found her place at the Texas Warbird Museum, where her passion for flying and her dedication to her craft shone brightly. But she was more than just a pilot; Devyn‚Äôs infectious laughter, daring enthusiasm, and unwavering kindness touched the lives of countless individuals. Whether soaring through the air or sharing captivating stories, she had an exceptional ability to put everyone at ease. Devyn‚Äôs dreams reached beyond the clouds as she aspired to create the Texas Warbird Museum, preserving the legacy of vintage military aircraft and the heroic stories of the brave pilots who served their country. Her hard work and determination served as an inspiration to all, making her a true visionary with wings.</p><p><strong>Post below:</strong><br>Erin Miller<br>Thank you Devyn for your enthusiastic devotion to honoring the history of the Women Airforce Service Pilots WASP. Thank you for flying me in your beautiful BT-13, ‚ÄúLucky 13.‚Äù The BT-13 was the plane my grandmother was assigned after training concluded to instruct male pilots on instruments in Las Vegas. Anyone who flew with Devyn had a view of her pink helmet prominently displaying Fifinella, the mascot of the WASP of World War II.<br>On Monday‚Äôs panel talk on the WASP at Oshkosh, Devyn said that she was honored to ‚Äúland on the same dirt where the WASP had landed and in the same model of plane they had flown,‚Äù at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. When she was uncharacteristically late for our panel discussion Saturday morning, I received an unconfirmed message that her T-6 had gone down in the lake nearby. Although I hoped for a better outcome, I knew in my heart that Devyn would never forfeit the opportunity to share her love for the history of the WASP and the planes she and they both flew.<br>WASP Elizabeth Magid wrote the poem, ‚ÄúCelestial Flight,‚Äù in honor of fellow WASP Marie Robinson. You can look up the full poem, but I will leave here this stanza: ‚ÄúThat she is only flying higher, Higher than she‚Äôs ever flown.‚Äù My love to Hunter Reiley Jeremy Reiley and all of Devyn Reiley‚Äôs family, friends, and the warbird community. Fly high with the WASP, Devyn üíï‚ù§Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è ‚òÅÔ∏è</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Actually_happened></span><strong>What Actually happened? </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On the south end of the EAA AirVenture flightline at Wittman Regional Airport, tragedy struck as a helicopter and a gyrocopter collided at 12:24 p.m. Both aircraft, the Rotorway 162F helicopter, and the ELA Eclipse 10 gyrocopter belonged to attendees of the event and were not part of the air show.

Despite their efforts to contain the situation, the incident halted aircraft operations at the airport for approximately two hours.</p><p><strong>A Swift Response:</strong></p><p>The quick response of the EAA, Winnebago County Sheriff‚Äôs Department, and Oshkosh Fire Department to the accident was commendable. Their immediate action reflects the commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of all attendees, and their presence provided solace during this tragic incident.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Day_of_Tragedy_in_Aviation></span><strong>A Day of Tragedy in Aviation:</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The collision at EAA AirVenture came only hours after another plane crash in Lake Winnebago, which claimed the lives of both passengers on board.
